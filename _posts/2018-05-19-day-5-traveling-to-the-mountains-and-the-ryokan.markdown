Hi everyone, Today was, thankfully, a pretty chill day. We’ve been hitting things pretty hard in Tokyo, and though Disney Sea was AMAZING we woke up today feeling exhausted. I had a hunch that this might happen, so I planned in a relaxing day for us today.

We got to sleep in for the first time on our trip . . . at least in theory. I woke up at 5am, because I’ve been having a really hard time acclimating to the time change on this trip. I’ve been waking up bright eyed and bushy tailed at 2am, but can usually power through and force myself to stay in bed until 5am. By then I’m so bored that I may as well just get up. So I was up at 5am, but Jimmy got to sleep in a bit.

We checked out of our hotel and hit the road for the train station. Speaking our hotel, it was near a college campus, so here’s the view from our window.

How cool would it be to go to college a 15 minute bike ride from Disneyland? So jealous. Speaking of bikes, everyone bikes here and it’s kind of amazing. They have special lanes on the sidewalks for bikers, which seems much more civilized than the no rules biking in Seattle, and we didn’t see anyone wearing spandex biking shorts. Here they bike in business suits and adorable skirts. Not even kidding.

W hopped a train back to Tokyo, to begin our journey to Nagano and on to a small hot springs town in the mountains. We had some time to grab lunch in Tokyo station, and I got a chance to look around at some of the shops. Which are wild.

There’s a huge fad in Japan for all things tiny, including these little scenes and garden that people create as hobbies.

There was also a Sailor Moon cosmetics store.

We had our first soba experience in Japan. The soba was great, and we got to eat surrounded by Japanese businessmen who have the soba slurp down. In Japan many people eat noodle dishes by loudly slurping them. Yes, it’s super rude to do in the US, but in Japan you’re kind of weird if you don’t. We met some ladies from the UK who were LOVING Japan, but stated, “I want to do it, but it’s so rude where I’m from I just can’t bring myself to do it.” My hope for her is that by the end of her trip she’ll be slurping with the best of them.

Here’s our soba.

There’s a long drawn out story behind why this happened, but we spent about 30min wandering around looking for an ATM that takes foreign cards, and eventually had to leave the station and go to a mall to find one. Here’s a pic of me wandering Tokyo station with my luggage, looking way happier than I felt.

Poor Jimmy’s half-hearted smile is closer to reality.

We found our ATM, then spent some time enjoying the trains. Including this lovely bullet train. This is one of the fastest trains in the world.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId11.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId11.jpg)

 we hit the train tracks to Nagano, which I knew sounded familiar, but didn’t realize that I’d seen it on TV while watching the winter Olympics back in the late 1990’s.

If you’ve followed us on other trips, you know I love a good train ride. There’s nothing like sitting back with some snacks to enjoy beautiful scenery while someone else takes care of the driving. On this ride we left the city and headed into the mountains. It was lovely.

It’s so hard to get pics from a train since you’re moving so fast, but here’s some of my tries. The day started out cloudy, but ended up being beautiful and sunny.

One of my favorite things about Japan has been the architecture of the buildings. They have very modern looking buildings in Tokyo, but they also have the traditional Japanese structures that are so different than the buildings of any of the other places we’ve been.

The view from Nagano Station

On a side note, I talked in an earlier post about the squatting toilets. Here’s an example of one at Nagano station.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId19.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId19.jpg)

You’re welcome for that. They also have these handy baby holders in the bathrooms all over Japan.

Brilliant, right? My favorite part are the directions above the seat. “Don’t leave”. Like maybe people are putting their babies in the baby holders next to the toilets and using them as daycare?

At Nagano we changed trains, and got on one of the ricketiest trains I’ve ever been on. This thing was like The Little Engine that could. There were times when it felt like maybe it couldn’t. But it did. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId23.jpg)

It chugged on up into the mountains.

And we eventually made it our traditional Ryokan in our hot springs town just down the mountain from the Snow Monkey Park. A ryokan is a traditional Japanese inn, that has natural hot springs or “onsen” and serves amazing food in the traditional Japanese style. 

We were greeted at the train station by a beautiful woman in a traditional kimono who drove a 15 passenger van down tiny little lanes like a boss. At the ryokan, we were greeted with tea and informed of what to expect for our traditional experience.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId30.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId30.jpg)

We were taken to our traditional room, which starts as a sitting room, and scheduled our dinner and time at their private onsen. We were also told that people wear yukata’s (traditional comfy robes) while at the ryokan, and that the yukatas are easy to put on.

Our room.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId34.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId34.jpg)

We spent some time trying to figure out how to tie our yukatas from the directions they provided.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId35.jpg)

We eventually gave up and Googled it. Which landed us here

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId36.jpg)

Oh yes, we are awesome. They left origami instructions and paper in our room, so we spent some time trying to figure that out while waiting for our time in the onsen. We again had to utilize Google.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId37.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId37.jpg)

Eventually we figured that out too, and made our to the private onsen

We took charge of it just as the sun was starting to set

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId40.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId40.jpg)

And lounged out.

After the onsen it was time for our traditional, 9 course Kaiseki dinner. Our server was so kind to us, and took time to explain every dish. Enjoyed our meal, and enjoyed getting to know her even more. We’re Facebook friends now, which means we now have two Japanese pen palls from this trip.

Everything was beautifully presented, and the food was really good.

When we got back from dinner, they had put out our traditional bedding. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId48.jpg)

Not going to lie, it was a lot like camping.

We decided to hit the rooftop bar to try some sake, so I put on the socks they provided which are supposed to go with traditional sandals. The toe situation was uncomfortable for me, so I ended up just rocking my own socks.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId49.jpg)

Their rooftop bar had little heated igloos, and you sat with your legs under a warmer blanket. It was hard to get a good pic of it, but it was a lot of fun.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/17/imagerId52.jpg)

And that seemed like a great way to end a very relaxing day. 

Good night.
