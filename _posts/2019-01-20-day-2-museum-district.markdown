Woohoo! Day 2! Also know as our first real full day in Paris. Normally when we travel, I find myself waking up ridiculously early, but the bed at AirBnB is AMAZING and I woke up to my alarm at 7am. Jimmy and I rushed to get ready and head out the door to meet up with my friend Melissa at the Louvre, as well her mom (Ruby) and her friend (Amy).

On the way to the Louvre, we saw this lovely little sign.

Due to the busyness of the Louvre, we always try to get there before opening, and use the entrance below the main entrance in the Carousel mall. We meant to stop for breakfast, but our awesome sleep meant we were running late, so we found ourselves dropping into a Starbucks in the mall. If you’ve followed our blog before, you know that we view Starbucks as an international experience in and of itself. We try to stay away, but are always pleasantly surprised by how much better it is in other countries. This experience was no exception. They had a machine to make fresh pressed orange juice, and Jimmy declared that “there were so many blueberries” in the muffins. Why so much better in Europe?

Here’s my awesome fresh pressed juice

After our quick breakfast, we hopped in line just in time to wander into the Louvre, which was nearly empty.

We found our friends, and started making our way through the exhibits. Here are some favorites:

And, after a what felt like hours (because it was), we were ready to move on.

We wandered through the Tuileries garden in search of Angelina’s and their famous hot chocolate. Word on the street is that it is the best in Paris.

Last time we came to Paris I was so excited to try Angelina’s chocolate, but it was closed. This time, we made it!

So tasty. We all had lunch as well. Then, we hit . . . another museum! This time we headed to see Monet’s Waterlilies at l’orangerie. It was beautiful. Pictures really don’t do it justice, but you know me. I had to try.

After visiting the impressionists, we decided to mix things up with . . . another museum! Because, apparently, you can never have enough. Except you totally can. We headed across the street to the d”Orsay. 

This pic is on the Paris bridge of locks. The government keeps removing the locks because they are ruining the bridge and polluting the river, but people keep putting them up. Jimmy and I decided just to take a picture instead.

Ok, the building d”orsay is beautiful. It’s in an old train station and the layout is amazing

I’m pretty sure this one is the painting Lauralie acts out in Gilmore Girls?

Now that we have seen all the art work, we decided to head to Le Bon Marche. Wandering Paris:

At some point while mindlessly wandering the store, we realized that we’d lost Jimmy and were getting hungry. He had found a park nearby and we were all ready to head to the Montmartre area while my friends were staying to get some dinner.

Sacre Coeur

Dinner was awesome. We went to a neighborhood Brassiere where we were the only English speakers and got the biggest dinner ever. We also picked up another friend, Andrea, and got photo bombed by the bar tender. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190120/imagerId79.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190120/imagerId79.jpg)

No one spoke English at this place, but everyone was pretty determined to make it work anyway. Jimmy made friends with a sweet older woman sitting next to him, who was very patient with him when he started practicing French with her. The rest of the table teased me about Jimmy being stolen by the lady, and how if I asked her to step outside and settle things she would probably win. Despite (or perhaps because of) the walker. 

The bar tender decided to go ahead and take an honest pic with us.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190120/imagerId80.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190120/imagerId80.jpg)

Also, Jimmy and Melissa needed a whole extra table just to hold their food, which is truly lovely.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190120/imagerId82.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190120/imagerId82.jpg)

After that, our friends went out to find some more fun, but Jimmy and I headed home. Because the old lady at the brasserie has nothing on me.

Good night.
