We left Seattle at 3pm on Friday afternoon, and arrived at Paris at noon on Saturday. The time change and flight durations basically mean that we are running no sleep, but luckily Café culture is strong in Paris, so we have continued to find fortitude today. 



Until now. When it’s 8pm Paris time and we’re heading into bed. 



Over all, things went pretty smoothly. I got to use up some old Icelandic Kronos that I have accidently brought home from our last trip on muffins and juice in the airport in Reykjavik, and the seat next to us and behind us was empty, so it was pretty comfy flight. I was hoping to see Northern lights from the plane, but the weather was too overcast.

We landed in Paris and we able to find out home away from home in the Marias district. We pretty much love this neighborhood. Lots of restaurants, cute shops, and lovely squares. It’s also near the Jewish quarter which means we got to dine some amazing and super cheap Falafel sandwiches for dinner.



Here’s a bit of what it looks like:

The first thing we did after landing in Paris was go lunch hunting. We ended up a really cute place called Le Loir  (Or the Door Mouse and the Tea Pot) We had a great lunch there, and decided we needed to come back because their dessert look legendary.

After lunch we wandered out to the Louvre. Jimmy got to see all of the art he wants, and we used Rick Steves free audio tour to keep us on track. The Louvre was amazing, and  the art was breathtaking.

 after all the hype I’d heard about how small the Mona Lisa was, I had excepted her to fit in my pocket. She didn’t.



Jimmy’s caption for this pic: Now you can prove you were there.

After touring the Louvre we wandered around the area outside at night. The pyramid was lit up and pretty, and in the distance we saw the Eiffel tower light up for it’s nightly show.

We’ll see it closer another night. We tried to walk to Angelina for their famous hot chocolate, but were told that they only do dinner reservations in he evenings. We’ll try to make it back in an afternoon. That’s when we dropped in and got our falafels, and now, after 24 hours with no sleep, we’re turning in early. 



Cool pic from our stroll home:
