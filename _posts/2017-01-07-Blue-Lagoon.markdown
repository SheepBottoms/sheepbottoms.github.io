Our adventures in Europe this time around have been completely amazing, but today is the day we head home. Our flight was in the late afternoon, so I planned a little excursion to the famously beautiful Blue Lagoon so we could do some relaxing before our flight. 

We got there as soon as it opened, which was nice because it was very dark and serene, and not too crowded. Since it was the last thing on our trip, I decided to go all out and got us the luxury package at the lagoon, which included our own private room and access to the special lounge with food and snacks. We also had an indoor access to lagoon so that we didn’t have to run through the cold air in our swimming suits.
For those who don’t know, the lagoon is a geothermal hot springs, which is surrounded by lava rock and has a silica bottom. It gives it an amazing turquois color, and it said to be filled with minerals that having healing properties.

Basically, it’s a giant, gorgeous bath tub, which is obviously one of my favorite things. They’ve basically turned it into a spa now, complete with massages, silica facials, and a swim up bar. We also joked because they had people walking around with flashlights checking on everybody, We decided that “funny business” must not allowed in the Blue Lagoon and called them the “Sex police.”

Here’s what it looked like before the sun came up.

And here’s our VIP lounge

This is the VIP balcony overlooking the lagoon

The lagoon is busy, that in order to go you have to book ahead of time. When you get there they split you into two lines, the basic package lines, and the lines with the luxury package and people who booked massages. We walked up to the front and she scanned our tickets, then stopped and said. “Oh, please wait just a moment.” We thought we were in trouble. Like maybe we had been red flagged and weren’t going to be allowed in.
She returned with a young gentleman who introduced himself as out concierge. Yep, we had our own concierge. 
He showed us our room, the lounge, and our private balcony. The lounge included coffee, fruit, chocolate, and comfy chairs by a fire place. 
After that, we hopped right in. It was amazing.

Jimmy had much better luck enjoying his. And mine.

Then we just sat around and soaked up what they call “the proven healing properties”.

Jimmy, who had a cold, was looking better already!

The bottom of the lagoon water in the lagoon is rich in minerals, and in particular silica. The whole bottoms used to be covered in silica, but now they have layered the bottom with concrete, and you get the silica masks from buckets in a hut. The silica continues to collect however, and Jimmy found a deposit in a secluded location. He thought he’s try it out.

I got mine directly from the hut and put it on my face like everyone else. Jimmy took this picture and stated, “I don’t think you want to see this one. You look like a creepy clown.” He was right.

His next comment: “Wait, did you just do a selfie with duck face?

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20170107/image17.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20170107/image17.jpeg)

Yes, yes I did.
After that it was time to head out of the water, and make our lunch reservations at the Lava restaurant attached to the Blue Lagoon. It was lovely and the food was great, but it was weird to see everyone at a nice restaurant in bathrobes. One couple even had their hair in towels.
After that, our time in Iceland was up. One more picture with the lagoon before catching the shuttle to the airport.

Thanks to everyone who has followed us on our travels, and who has prayed for our safety. This trip was so much smoother than our last one (no nightmare ferry ride or loss of passport this time which feels like a win). We can’t wait to find time to see everyone when we have recovered, and please, let me know if you have been inspired to go to any of these places and want to take me with you.

For the last time: Good night.
