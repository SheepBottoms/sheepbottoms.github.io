What a ride! This morning we got up at 6am and made our way to the Belfast International Airport for our flight to London. The whole time we were in Northern Ireland people were telling us that a huge storm was forecasted to hit Belfast on Christmas Eve, which completely freaked me out because I’m terrified of flying even in good weather. Luckily for us, the storm never hit (or it waited until we left) because our flight was able to make it out on time and wasn’t too bumpy.

A couple of things about flying. I’m an EXTREMELY nervous flyer. Anything can freak me out. Something that happens in the airport: FREAKED. A weird look on a flight attendant’s face: FREAKED. A plane that gets just slightly delayed: TOTAL FREAK OUT. Prop planes freak me out the most, but my second most hated factor in flying is flying Ryanair. 

Everything about it is miserable. The planes are jam packed even more than most (which freaks me out) and they nickel and dime you for everything (that doesn’t freak me out; it just makes me angry.) Unfortunately, Ryanair was also the least expensive option (aren’t they always) and they had the best flight times, so going into this I already knew I had factors working against me. Going in knowing that, I’m already primed to lose complete confidence to all airports, airplanes, and staff members as soon as something looks amiss. 

Enter the Belfast International Airport. This whole place is amiss. It is literally falling apart. As we were walking towards security there was a bunch of wet plaster on the ground from where a part of the roof had fallen in. Seriously, a part of the roof had fallen in and they just left it! At the waiting area by the gate they had buckets out to catch dripping water. I was using my deep breathing skills like there was no tomorrow, which at that point I thought there might not be. I thought the whole building would fall down. It didn’t, and about 20 minutes after taking my anti-anxiety medication I was starting to feel much better. I was also wondering through the airport stores looking to buy anything and everything. Fun side effect of the medication. 

We landed on time and had an easy journey to our home base for London. Since it was Christmas Eve, I had a myriad of plans to celebrate the holiday, which all culminated in attending the first Eucharist of Christmas at Westminster Abbey.
We started out with some ice skating at Somerset house. Somerset house is a gorgeous building, and at Christmas time is taken over Fortnum and Mason who turn it into a real Christmas paradise.

You have to buy tickets ahead of time with preplanned times slots so the ice doesn’t get overcrowded (hint hint Seattle ice rink). We got there a bit early, so we were able to eat at a café inside the building and grab some Christmas caramel. Just as the sun went down, we got to hit the ice.

Rather than just being regular light on the ice, the lights were blue and purple, so we’ve got the funky light reflecting on our faces.

After doing some ice skating, we decided to take a leisurely 45 minute walk to our next destination. We passed through The Strand and Trafalgar Square, and got to see some pretty great Christmas Eve buskers.

Our next destination was Hyde Park, which was all decked out for their Winter Wonderland festival.

This place was unreal. There was a huge line to get in, but we had bought tickets online to a couple of attractions so the let us skip the line. Which made us feel like rock stars.
We enjoyed some food at the Bavarian Village.

Yes, my friends, that is pork roasting over an open fire. Nat King Cole should have sung about that. But he did sing about the one below.

Jimmy enjoyed some bratwurst.

While being watched by this dude. Serious props if anyone can tell me who this guy is and what he’s about.

The park looked amazing. They had tons of rides and craft markets with chalets.

The chalet above was advertising Hot Cider. I was so excited to get some, only to try it and realize that it was hard core spiked. It smelled awful, and tasted even worse. I don’t even think it had an apple flavor. Even Jimmy couldn’t drink it.

Our first stop after dinner was The Magical Ice Kingdom, with all of the ice sculptures. It was pretty cool.

Jimmy got to captain an ice expedition.

And I got to FINALLY go dog sledding

After the ice kingdom, we had tickets to visit the Ice Bar.

Basically, it was bar where everything was made of ice. Even the glasses and seats. They gave us ridiculous ponchos to wear, but Jimmy totally rocked them.

Me? Not so much. But the camera on Jimmy’s phone made the ice look pretty cool.

Our last scheduled winter carnival event was to ride on the Giant Wheel, which was basically an enclosed ferris wheel.

I talk about my fear of flying a lot, but did you know Jimmy has a fear of heights? True statement.

Quote from Jimmy, “This is me, trying to look like I got this.”

Me feeling like I actually do “have it” for once.

After the wheel, we had a choice to make. We could head to the BnB for an hour before heading to Westminster Abbey, or we could keep playing at Hyde Park. 
We decided to do a little roller coaster.

And I got a waffle.

I also got a new hat, because my former one was stretched out when someone we will not name forgot his hat and borrowed mine. Now it falls off my head all the time.

Jimmy wasn’t sure about my new hat. He said, “I don’t know that you’re really a pompom person.” I disagree. I totally think I rock the pompom.

At that point it was time to head over to the Abbey. We couldn’t take pictures inside during the service, but here’s some pictures of us waiting in line to get in.

It was a bit chilly outside, and incidentally, it was also really chilly inside. The service was incredible. It was our first time in the Abbey (we’ll be touring it later in the week), and it is so beautiful. We also really enjoyed getting to hear the organ and the choir. If you get a chance to do midnight mass, we definitely recommend it. 

The strangest part about the mass was the mad dash for a cab when it ended. We all sat there together, hearing about Jesus coming to bring peace, joy, and love, then an hour later people are stealing cabs and yelling at each other. We called an Uber and went home in peace. 

Good night.
