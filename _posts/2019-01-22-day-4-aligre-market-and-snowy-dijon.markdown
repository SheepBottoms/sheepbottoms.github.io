Hey friends! Today was another lovely day in Paris, although it was a cold one. I woke up very excited about the activities planned for the morning. 

First of all, the stars aligned for the morning, and it was a planning miracle. I had REALLY been wanting to do a market tour when we were in Paris, and I had seen a specific one on AirBnB that really spoke to me. The timing wasn’t right for our train to Dijon, so I messaged her and she was able to move the tour time and opened it up just for our group of 5. 

Speaking of our group of five, we were very sad to lose Amy today. She’s not dead. She just flew to Iceland then home to hang with her family. We missed you today, Amy!

The tour also happened to be a 10 minute walk from the train station that the train Jimmy and I were leaving on for Burgundy region was at, and it was 5 minute walk from a bakery that my friend Melissa had heard good things about and was excited to go. I know, perfect, right?

Anyway, I wanted to start the morning off by trying the juicing machines that I had seen in all the grocery stores. You grab a bottle, choose your fruit, and get to juicing. I chose the traditional orange juice.

And it was glorious

We then headed to Gare de Lyon to drop off our luggage since we needed to check out of our Airbnb. Which was sad because it was awesome. At Gare de Lyon, we saw the mother ship of the lime bikes.

We then hit the streets of the Bastille district in search of Blue Sucre, which Melissa said was the best croissants in Paris.

As we were walking, it started snowing. Snow in Paris! So fun!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId10.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId10.jpg)

We made it to the bakery, and found our friends waiting for us with all of this goodness

This is another version of the three kings tart

Nom Nom Nom

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId16.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId16.jpg)

By then the snow was really picking up, so we decided to go play in it.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId17.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId17.jpg)

Jimmy decided to keep eating breakfast

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId20.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId20.jpg)

Melissa got Jimmy dancing. She’s such a great influence

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId21.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId21.jpg)

Snow!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId22.jpg)

Jimmy was determined to do the blue steel

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId23.jpg)

The ladies taking some shelter in a doorway

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId25.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId25.jpg)

By then it was time to end play time, and time for the market tour to begin. Outside. In the snow.

We were greeted by our awesome host, Natasha, who came bearing lots of treats in a magical Marry Poppins Style bag. She kept pulling out more wonderful things throughout the tour, starting with this lovely pastry. She told us it’s the new French breakfast.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId26.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId26.jpg)

We then hit the produce part of the market, and learned about local produce and new standards France has set so that market goers know where their produce is coming from. She told us French cooking is really big on only using produce in season.

The market

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId27.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId27.jpg)

Natasha showed us some garlic that is now recognized as a UNESCO world heritage something or another. She said it’s the best garlic in the world.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId30.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId30.jpg)

Next she took us to an award winning fromagerie and taught us all about French cheese. She finagled some magic that made it sound like French cheese was actually good for you. I’ll take it.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId31.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId31.jpg)

She also told us that the French cook soups with old cheese rather than throwing it away. Here is some old cheese someone might use for cooking

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId32.jpg)

Natasha whipped a baguette out of her bag, and we got to do some cheese tastings on baguette. Jimmy found some creamy goat cheese that he loved, so we left with some.

More snowy market wandering

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId34.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId34.jpg)

We also tried some fresh oysters in lemon. I’d never had then before, but volunteered to go first on the taste testing. It was actually pretty good.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId35.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId36.jpg)

We got to go to two different butchers and learn the importance in French culture of having a good butcher. More taste testing occurred. One of the butchers was known as the best butcher in Paris.

Here’s the meat

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId39.jpg)

We also dropped by the cheese monger to the President of France, where we had more samples, and Natasha pulled a wine bottle out of her magic bag

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId41.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId41.jpg)



We got some oranges

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId42.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId42.jpg)

And these incredible little puff desserts

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId44.jpg)

And all the while, it was like this outside

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId45.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId45.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId52.jpg)

By that point we were over 2 hrs in, frozen, and it was time to hit up a local wine bar. They get barrel aged wines at this bar, and pour directly from the barrel into your glass.

Do you think Jimmy sees the guy coming out of the floor in the background? I don’t

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId55.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId55.jpg)

Cheers!

Natasha hung with us for a while and answered our questions about Paris, France, and food. Then it was time for all of us to go our separate ways. Jimmy and I were heading to Dijon in Burgundy, and Melissa, her mom, and Andrea were planning to spend some more time in Paris. Bye friends!

Heading back to the train station

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId57.jpg)

Gare de Lyon

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId58.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId58.jpg)

Train stations are always cold, and today was especially cold. Jimmy got some coffee

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId59.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId59.jpg)

And we hopped on our snowy train. I tried to get some train pictures for the nephews.

The trip to Dijon was absolutely gorgeous! It’s so hard to get good pictures from a train, but here are some attempts so you can get the idea

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId62.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId62.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId63.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId63.jpg)

Yeah, I actually couldn’t find any that do it justice.

We got to Dijon, which is adorable, and checked into our Airbnb, which is also adorable

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId64.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId64.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId65.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId65.jpg)

It was already dark outside and the snow was still coming down, but Burgundy is famous for wine and food so we headed out to Chez Leon for traditional Burgundy food. In the summer Dijon is a popular tourist destination, but very few tourists in the winter means you get to wander into any restaurant without a reservation. 

Our stroll before dinner

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId66.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId66.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId67.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId67.jpg)

The food was great. I ordered my first escargot, and it was tasty. I’m actually not sure what the big deal is about it being gross. It was covered in garlic and pesto. What’s not to love? The waitress brought it out, and we had to google how to eat it. I’m still not sure we did it right.

We also got beouf bourgunione,and my favorite wine. Overall, a very tasty night

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId72.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190122/imagerId72.jpg)

The walk back to our place in the snow was very beautiful

That last pic is Burgundy’s Notre Dame cathedral. There’s construction going on around it right now, but it’s still so beautiful. More pics on that another day.

For now, it’s time to hunker down into our cozy loft, and try to get some sleep.

Good night.
