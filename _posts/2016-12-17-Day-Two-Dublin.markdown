At Heathrow we found out that our flight to Dublin was delayed by two hours, so we found the magical land inside the airport called The Giraffe. The Giraffe is a super hippie place that serves smoothies, juice, bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, French toast, porridge, and a variety of mixed cocktails. My smoothie came with a giraffe straw. Lovely. 

I also found a candy store that let me try all the Turkish delight I wanted. That made me think of The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, because that is the only place where I have heard about that candy. Hopefully the White Witch won't come and ruin Christmas because I ate the candy.

We had an easy flight to Dublin, and when we landed we got some truly traditional Irish food (my favorite Irish stew and soda bread, or course) at a place called the Boxty house. This has become my inaugural Irish culinary tradition. NumNumNum

 We had beautiful sunny weather this evening in Dublin, and it looks so traditionally Christmassy with all of the stores, public squares, pubs, coffee shops, and restaurants decorated. It already has the charm of lovely cobble stone streets, Victorian town homes, and stone buildings, but Christmas brings a little something special.
 
  The Temple Bar area is especially festive right now.

Jimmy and I were so tired after having not slept in what feels like days, and we debated whether or not to go an Irish rugby match that I’d bought tickets for. Staying in our lovely home-away-from-home and falling asleep at 7pm like 90 year olds was sounding very tempting. In the end we decided we couldn't let the opportunity pass, and we should at least check it out.

It was amazing! The fans were out of control with excitement, but still managed to show respect to everyone regardless of the team they were cheering for. It became obvious pretty quickly to everyone around us that we had no idea what was going on, so they collectively decided to teach us. The people next to me told me about rules and strategy, while the gentleman next to Jimmy taught him the art of out of control cheering, which included dancing, singing “when the saints go marching in”, and even adding polite cheers for the other team. Dublin’s native team of Leinster was playing England’s Northamptom. The gentleman next Jimmy stated, “Yeah, not many Irish people here like the English. Weird, isn’t it.” Everyone around him laughed, mainly because he was wearing a Northamptom shirt, but clearly spoke with an Irish accent. So much fun!

 After that, we went home and slept like rocks. Big amazing day tomorrow.
