Jimmy and I are both a bit embarrassed to admit this, but a large portion of our day was centered around getting a Harry Potter style picture at Kings Cross Station Platform 9 ¾.

We had planned to head to York today, then up to Edinburgh in Scotland, which meant that we were already scheduled to be at Kings Cross station this afternoon. I had seen pictures of lovely muggles like myself heading to Platform 9 ¾ where you get to cross the barrier in hopes of catching the Hogwarts Express, but I had read online that the line for this can get ridiculous, we again got up long before the sun and headed to Kings Cross station 5 hours before our train was scheduled to leave.

At 8:30am we were in line that took almost 45 minutes to get through, but people, I made it through and I’m going to Hogwarts!

Actually, I just got a souvenir picture, but it’s still pretty awesome. You can see in my picture I’m wearing Hufflepuff colors, because despite always wanting to be in Griffindor, every online test I have ever answered honestly has put me in Hufflepuff. Since Newt from the Extraordinary Beasts movies was also a Hufflepuff, I decided to wear the colors proudly. 

Jimmy is usually placed in Ravenclaw, so he wore those colors.

After getting our pictures, we headed out to grab breakfast. Can I just say, Pret A Manger saved our lives on this trip. We were constantly looking for quick coffee and reliable ok food to go, and they delivered. Thanks Pret!

After breakfast, we headed out to the British Library, where we got to see original writings of incredible authors such as Jane Austen and Shakespeare, and we got to view the Magna Carta and illuminated Bibles. I was pretty much in love, but strangely I was ready to go long before Jimmy. This was odd to me, because I looked at everyone book in their museum room, and read every plaque. I also like literature more than Jimmy. When I found him, he stated that he was ready to go, but hadn’t been able to see everything. I decided he must stand and ponder things very deeply at museums.

After the British library we headed back to Kings Cross to get lunch and get ready for our train. Throughout the UK they have constant announcement at train stations with the slogan “If you see something, say something”, referring to reporting suspicious activity of other passengers. Keep that in mind for a moment.
Today the temperature in London fell to being much colder than it had been previously, and Kings Cross does not have heat. It felt colder in the station than outside. I had on multiple pairs of gloves, and was huddled down in my scarf. As we sat, a repeating announcement stated, “Due to inclement weather the station may be slick in spots. Extra caution is necessary.” 

During the 87th repeat of that statement I leaned over to Jimmy and stated, “Due to the cold weather you might actually freeze to death. Please check your neighbor to make sure they have not frozen to death, and alert authorities if they have,”

Jimmy stated, “If you see something, say something.” 

Also, I got a hot cocoa in an attempt to stay warm. At first I thought the barista didn’t even try to get my name right and just wrote random letters on the cup, but after looking again I think it might be even worse. I think he thought my name was Peach, which is a horrible thought.

The train to York was a lovely ride, as all trains in Europe seem to be. We didn’t get in to York until after dark, but we could already tell that it is a beautiful town. It used to be fortressed, and the castle walls remain. It looked a bit like Derry, but it definitely had its own flavor.

Like this random Viking themed pop up pub. There wasn’t a trace of it the next morning.

And it has a gorgeous Minster, which we saw in the daylight the next day, so stayed tuned.
I also found this amazing place called the Cat Gallery. What’s not to like?

It truly looked lovely all decked out for the holidays.

We had some dinner, then went to the Guy Fawkes Pub for drinks. York is famous for chocolatiers and breweries. Jimmy got a Ghost Stout that supposedly had hints of chocolate. I hate beer so it tasted like burnt grain to me. Jimmy said it was amazing. I had cider that had a really weird after taste. It literally tasted the way urine smells. I told Jimmy that I was taking one for the team by drinking pee water with him so he could enjoy a real York beer. He was not amused.

Good night
