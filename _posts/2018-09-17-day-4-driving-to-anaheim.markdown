I’m going to be honest, we’re light on the pictures today. We still had an amazing day, but a lot of it was spent driving so this will likely be a short post.

We started out by heading to a bakery recommended to us by my friend Piper called Con Pane. We were told we would find amazing cinnamon rolls there, and we did! They were perfectly glazed and warmed, and it was a great way to start our day.

After enjoying the breakfast we made our way to Carlsbad to check in on another friend from college. Brittany was active in the theatre department with me, and was such an amazing friend when I lived in San Diego. We spent so much time goofing around, and I got to visit with her family. One of my favorite memories with Brittany was driving up to Anaheim and spending the day in Disneyland together. So much fun!

She owns a bakery now and does the MOST beautiful cakes, and she gave Jimmy and I some cookies to sample. Jimmy declared them “Probably the best cookies I’ve ever had”. I’ve got to figure out if she’s able to ship orders north, because now we’re addicted. Her company is called Taste and Sea Cakery, and you have got to look her up.

After spending some time drinking pumpkin spice lattes and catching up, it was time for Jimmy and I to head on. Our goal was to make it Anaheim before rush hour hit, and we had one more stop to make.

A while ago I stumbled on a store that makes ethically sourced, sustainable clothing that is actually nice enough to wear to work. I’d been stalking their clothing online for a while, but they are located in San Francisco and don’t have a store front in Seattle. I found out that they do have a store in Newport Beach, which just so happens to be on the way between Carlsbad and Anaheim. The clothing is more expensive than I would typically pay, so I asked for gift cards for my birthday back in June, and hoarded them waiting for this trip. Today, I finally got to go.

It was amazing, and I blew through my gift cards. Thanks family!

While I was shopping, Jimmy lounged:

I’m assuming he had a good time because this is one of only three pictures he took today. Here’s another one.

You’ll see the last one later.

While in Newport we also grabbed some lunch at a place called Bear Flag Fish Company, which was very fresh and yummy. When traveling, it always nice to find a great seafood salad to break up all the heavy food.

Unfortunately we couldn’t find forks, so we enjoyed our salad with chopsticks. In case you didn’t know, Jimmy is a chopstick pro. I’m not even kidding. He really is.

Other things of note on the drive was the amazing car we got take down highway 1. We rode in style

In a cherry red VW Bug. Guys, the clerk at the rental agency said it was the only economy choice left. We felt pretty ridiculous all weekend, but it was amazing at parallel parking. This picture was taken at a state park. We really needed to use the bathroom so the ranger let us hang there for a few minutes without paying. The joke was on us though, because the bathrooms were super gross. I told Jimmy there was a wet pair of socks and motorcycle gloves in my bathroom stall. He replied that there was “nothing but despair” in his.

We eventually made it to Anaheim, checked into our hotel, and were ripped off by the hotel’s coin machine which gave us $4.50 in quarters in exchange for our $5. It’s clearly a racket as the laundry machines only take quarters . . . I digress.

We headed to Downtown Disney for dinner and some light shopping. We also wanted to scope out breakfast options for tomorrow. While heading there, we were going the opposite direction to all the families leaving Disneyland. We saw a couple of parents yelling at their kids, two parents drop the F bomb while walking out, and a middle-aged man who almost ran right into me looking down at the ground zombie walking. This guy was DONE. He was not going to look anyone in the eye, and he was DEFINITELY not getting out of the way for ANYONE. We’ll see how we do tomorrow.

The lego store was pretty impressive

Ah, here’s the last picture Jimmy took

And I’m considering bringing home a new friend for Mongo and Tugger.

Now we’re trying to rest up so we can hit Disney bright and early.

Good night.
