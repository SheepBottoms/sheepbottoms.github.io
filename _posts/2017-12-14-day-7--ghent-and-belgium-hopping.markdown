Today we hit three Belgium towns in one day. It was wild, wild day in so many way.



We woke up in Bruges and enjoyed a nice breakfast at our lovely hotel. Can I just say, I’m kind of heartbroken to leave our hotel. It is so comfy and have I mentioned that it has a bathtub? Because it does. BTW, here’s some pics of the hotel:

We hopped in a cab and headed back to the Bruges train station for one last Bruges activity before hitting a train to Ghent. I’ve got to be honest, there was a lot I was excited about visiting in Bruges at Christmas time, but arguably the most exciting thing was the ice sculpture park they erected at the train station because . . . IT’S DISNEY THEMED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That’s right. It is the 25th anniversary of Disney Paris, and Bruges decided to commemorate that by dedicating their annual ice sculpture park to Disney characters. 



We bought our tickets, and the attendant at the door said, “have fun and stay warm.” Which seemed weird, until we stepped inside and realized that the temperature inside was waaaaay colder than outside. I asked Jimmy to take a picture and he stated, “I want you to think carefully about what picture you want, because I think it might cause me frostbite.” Noted. Luckily I had gloves that were tech friendly for my phone’s camera, so I could take a few. The lighting made the sculptures look awesome in person, but pictures didn’t come out quite as well so here are my best attempts.



Star Wars!

Being in with the ice sculptures actually made the 30 degree weather outside feel pretty warm. We had an open ticket from Bruges to Brussels, which allowed us to hop and off any train in the region. We decided to stop off at Ghent for the day before checking in to our Airbnb in Brussels. 



Ghent is another old Medieval town, but unlike Bruges it has come springing into the modern age by housing a popular university. In Bruges were some of the youngest people we saw, in Ghent we were some of the oldest. As soon as we got off the train it was clear that the city is full of students, which meant it was also full of life. It was a beautiful city, but while Bruges felt slow and lazy, Ghent felt vibrant. Don’t tell anyone, but we may have liked it a bit better.



The problem with Ghent was that our stay for the day rested on us being able to lock up our bags at the lockers at the train station. We had never had an issue with that before, so assumed it wouldn’t be a problem. Due to dropping into the ice sculptures in Bruges, we didn’t get into Ghent until about noon, and by then the lockers were full. We asked the information desk at the station for other options, and they basically just shrugged and told us there weren’t any other options. Rather than freak out and start crying, we decided to wait thirty minutes to see if anything opened up. If it didn’t we could catch a train to Brussels early. After about 20 minutes, a wonderful angel from above showed up and removed his luggage from a locker that was big enough to fit our luggage. Thanks you wonderful human being, where ever you are!



We knew that we needed to take tram 1 from the train station to the main markt in town, but there was a brief scuffle between me and Jimmy about which platform we needed to be one. I gave in because I have a terrible sense of direction, and Jimmy is usually right. Also, he assured me that he was sure. We hopped on the tram, and headed out . . . away from the city. Jimmy continued to sure we were going the right way, so we stayed on the tram until we were the only ones left on board and it stopped completely. We had reached the end of the line. We stayed on the tram until it started up again, this time going the direction we needed. As we passed back by the train station, I felt a bit vindicated that we stopped on the platform I had pointed out at the begging. Me being right on directions almost never happens, so I have to rub it in a bit when it does. Jimmy forgives me.



We arrived in the historic city center just in time for lunch, and followed all of the young students to a trendy and cheap restaurant that specializes in Belgian meatballs. Yes, meatballs. They are delicious. And cheap. Jimmy told me to take a picture of the sign because he didn’t think anyone would believe the name, but it’s a chain in Belgium so if you’ve been and you like to eat like students you may have heard of it.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId20.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId20.jpg)



Ok, that’s a terrible, blurry picture so you probably cant even read the sign. It’s called Balls of Glory. And here they are in all their glory:



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId21.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId21.jpg)



The people working were super friendly, which was good because if you’ve never been they do have to explain their system to you. Basically they have four different types of meatballs each day. The meat balls are made of pork or chicken, crusted with bread crumbs and herbs, then filled with a special sauce. You choose your ball, choose if you would like them on salad or potatoes, then take a seat anywhere in the place and somehow they remember who you are and what you ordered. I imagine it was easy for them to remember us because we were old, but I have no idea how they kept the 30 or so college students who all looked alike straight. To their credit, they did ask us if we were students because there is a student discount. We decided to retire the student gimmick for discounts along with the honeymoon one and just accept that we’re old.



My meatball was pork and filled with a special seasonal sauce. They guy working stated, “It’s very Ghent to eat it this way.” Sure, pile it on.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId22.jpg)



I think it was some kind of a sweet gravy with tiny onions.



Jimmy got chicken and gravy



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId23.jpg)



And we both regretted getting salad rather potatoes, because the potatoes looked amazing. They also had fruit and water at each table for free, which was awesome because you usually have to pay for water in restaurants in Belgium. All in all, Balls of Glory is definitely on my recommend list for cheap, fast, and unique dining. We’re wondering what we need to do to bring it to Seattle.



After lunch we enjoyed another walking tour from Rick Steve’s Belgium guide book. Ghent has a river that flows through it, and it pretty beautiful. Like Bruges, it also had a Christmas market going on.



Here are some pics from the walk.

Ghent has a Cathedral that is famous in the art world for hosting a very old and famous altar piece. Here’s the Cathedral



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId43.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId43.jpg)



So, why this was hanging in the cathedral was never explained to us. No signs in the church letting us know, and not mentioned by Rick Steves.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId44.jpg)



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId45.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId45.jpg)



I tried to be reverent and not take pictures of the hollowed altar piece. Also, there were so many people crammed into the tiny room it is kept in that it would have been hard to get one. RS had a wonderful description on it, though, so no idea guide needed if you have his book.



Then more exploring. I found this little guy in a chocolate shop in the markt square.

They city of Ghent decided to fight illegal graffiti by creating an alleyway where graffiti was allowed and encouraged. It was pretty cool.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId52.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId57.jpg)



On the other side of the graffiti alley was this hipster shopping lane.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId59.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId59.jpg)



And then back to another beautiful square with cobblestone roads and historic buildings.

At this square there was a man doing a bubble show for kids. It was pretty fun to watch.

After watching the kids chasing the bubbles ( and maybe chasing a few myself) we continued on our walk.

And through some charming alleyways



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId80.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId80.jpg)



And found our way to historic Ghent sweet shot. Because, where else would we find our way to?



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId81.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId81.jpg)



She had the most adorable window displays of foxes trying to steal candy.

Those purple faces are a classic Ghent candy called Cuberdons. They are raspberry syrup covered with a caramelized shell. The shop owner told us they are local to Ghent only, and cannot be exported because they have a shelf life of a couple weeks.



The picture is blurry, but this was my favorite fox.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId84.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171208/imagerId84.jpg)

Man I look cold! It’s because I was. It was below freezing. We headed on our way to find our daily (or multiple times daily) ritual of hot cocoa, passing more beautiful places along the way.



Like this Christmas market.

Then we headed back to the train station and caught a train to Brussels. We quickly checked into our Airbnb and went on a hunt for food. The city was pretty busy, and we kept finding that restaurants were full. We ended up at a fish and chip place which felt like kind of a cop out, but hey, it was RS recommended. We headed back to the Airbnb around 9:30, and got to really check it out for the first time.



It was kind of horrifying. I went in to use the bathroom, and the toilet seat was up displaying feces on the rims. It was clear the toilet had not been cleaned. The shower looked equally dirty, and when I smelled the bed linens, they did not smell laundered. There were some other weird things, like there were tea light strewn about everywhere, with clear directions not to light them. Was that a test? Also, a couple of men’s work shirts and a pair of women’s leather boots were in the closet. Nothing else in the room, just those things. I had a complete melt down. I didn’t start crying, but I was close. We’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnbs. We’ve stayed in some pretty quirky ones, but I’ve never entered one that was so dirty. Luckily, I had Jimmy there to save the day. He found a great last minute deal on a nice hotel just a few blocks away, so we grabbed our luggage and hit the streets of Brussels at 10pm. The city was still very much alive at that time, and our hotel was in the area near the British parliament building so we were joined on the street by a lot of British businessmen and politicians. Our new hotel was great, and they were all out of standard rooms so they upgraded up to their sweet, which had . . . A BATHTUB. It also had the most comfortable bed we’ve had all trip. Good work to Jimmy who saved me from a night of being curled in a corner in the fetal position wondering if there were rats in the room.



Good night.
