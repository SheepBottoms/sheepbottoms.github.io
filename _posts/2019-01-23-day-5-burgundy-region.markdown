Good morning , friends! Today we woke up to beautiful Dijon covered in snow! Here’s the view from the window in our Airbnb loft

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId4.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId4.jpg)

It’s so lovely to see all the beautiful rooftops. We weren’t really sure what to expect from Dijon as it wasn’t even mentioned in Rick Steve’s guide book on France, but it was more convenient on our train route than the Burgundy town of Beaune which he recommends as being a home base in the region. 

Not realizing it was going to snow all night, we had rented a car and were planning on visiting cute villages throughout the French countryside and wine caves where small, local wineries do tastings. We are not easily deterred, so prepare yourself for lots of driving in snow pics. More on that later.

First, we hit the streets of Dijon looking for breakfast. Guys, Dijon is awesome. It’s most famous for mustard (which I don’t actually like) but it also a cute medieval center with towering cathedrals and beautifully timbered old homes. And lots of amazing food.

Here’s some morning pictures of Dijon:

We stumbled upon a little piece of home. Check out the advertisement in front of this café

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId11.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId11.jpg)

And Eventually ended up in a café that much more American coffee shop and much less French café, but it was still amazing

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId12.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId12.jpg)

We then headed back to our place to pic up the car, taking the scenic route.

Our BnB is very close to Dijon’s Notre Dame cathedral. The outside is being cleaned and restored, so there was some scaffolding around the building and some construction vehicles out front, but still amazing

We also found this naughty little knickknack. If Jimmy hadn’t been with me I would be coming home with it.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId23.jpg)

We made it back to the car, and the drive began. 

We drive through Dijon, and on into the French countryside. We wanted to visit a small, French village, and there was one not too far away that had a castle called Chateauneuf-en-Axois. We headed out into countryside, with me sticking my camera out the car window to take pictures.

Jimmy!

The drive started out nice and easy on a highway.

 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId31.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId31.jpg)

Then all of sudden we exited to this.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId32.jpg)

That area behind the sign . . . that was road Google Maps wanted us to take. That was obviously not happening in our rental car, so we took this instead

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId33.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId33.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId34.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId34.jpg)

It was about this time that the snow started to pick up again. Let’s be honest, it was beautiful. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId35.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId38.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId38.jpg)

We stumbled upon our first cute little village, and to honest, I don’t even know its name. It had this very cute church, though, and there were kids throwing snowballs behind it.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId39.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId43.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId43.jpg)

It also had a pretty cool castle hidden behind a pretty cool gate.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId44.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId45.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId45.jpg)

I was pretty excited to be in a village in France

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId46.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId46.jpg)

But we had a lot on our agenda so on to quaint village number 2.

Which was up this hill

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId47.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId47.jpg)

In this adorable little village

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId48.jpg)

Guys, this village was incredible. We only saw a couple of other people out and about, which almost made it better.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId49.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId50.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId50.jpg)

Castle! 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId51.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId51.jpg)

It said it was open and even had a caution sign put up on the foot bridge, but the door was shut. Jimmy trying to find a way in

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId52.jpg)

He rang the doorbell and . . .

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId53.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId53.jpg)

Nothing happened.

So we decided just to walk around the village

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId56.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId56.jpg)



Which was really just pure magic

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId57.jpg)

By the way, that’s a for sale sign in the window of that last picture. Hmmm.

The town had this (what I thought was cute, but what Jimmy thought was creepy) church

We knew someone was around, because we found this little snowman on the stone wall

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId84.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId84.jpg)

We literally took hundreds of pictures of this tiny little village, but the pictures don’t really do it justice, so I just need to stop. I was ready to just never leave.

However, nothing was open and we were getting hungry. We decided to leave the countryside, and head to the town of Beaune, nestled between the famous wine growing areas of Burgundy, and do some lunch and wine tasting.

Jimmy photobombing

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId85.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId85.jpg)

Ok, so the castle on the hillside is pretty cool

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId86.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId86.jpg)

Also, this was a giant cow type animal. I wanted Jimmy to get out and get a better pic of it, but his response was: “That is a really big animal and a really small fence.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId87.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId87.jpg)

Ah, welcome to Beaune!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId88.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId88.jpg)

Like Dijon, Beaune has a beautiful Medieval center to it’s city

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId89.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId89.jpg)

It’s signage game is also very good

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId90.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId90.jpg)

The sun appeared for a while, which made our walk around the city lovely.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId95.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId95.jpg)

Beaune is listed in the Rick Steve’s guide, and clearly pushes hard to cater to English speaking tourists

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId96.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId96.jpg)

We ended up here.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId97.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId97.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId98.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId98.jpg)

They are Patriarche, and they have one of the most historic and extensive cellars in the Burgundy. The cellars run under ground, and extend through most of the historic part of Beaune. 

They welcome visitors for tours and a 10 wine tasting. The tour is all via audio videos, which explains the wines of the regions and the history of the caves. It’s narrated by what appeared to be the ghost of historical figure connected to the winery (I really can’t remember who it was).

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId99.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId99.jpg)

You start out above ground in the cask room, and move into the chapel. Apparently before Patriarche took it over, it was a convent for widows. Because, you gotta keep those widows safe.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId100.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId100.jpg)

The ghost then invites you to descend deep into the cellars, some of which date back to the 13th century. I’m not going to lie, at this point it got a little creepy for me. I’m not really that into following disembodied voices into dark cellars, but we’d already paid so I figured I might as well take the risk. 

T [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId101.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId101.jpg) The cellars house literally thousands of wine bottles dating back a hundred years.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId102.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId102.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId103.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId103.jpg)

Apparently ghosts don’t update their signs very often. This one needs an update. How was the wine that somebody drank 19 years ago?

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId104.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId104.jpg)

You then enter this room for the ritual sacrifice . . . I mean wine tasting.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId105.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId105.jpg)

They give you these traditional Burgundian wine tasting vassals, then pretty much let you go town on 10 different wines with no supervision. Which seems like a bad business plan, but I guess ghosts don’t really need money. Just souls. . . 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId106.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId106.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId107.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId107.jpg)

This part I’m not even kidding about. We came around a corner in the tasting area and found this.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId108.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId108.jpg)

Let me zoom in a little closer for you

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId109.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId109.jpg)

Baaaaaah!

Seriously. At this point I’m assuming this is the end. The sign says it supposed to be Bacchus the Greek god of wine, but it looks an awful lot like someone else to me . . .

After a brief sells pitch (in which I refused to buy anything because I was afraid it would cost me my soul, and the wine wasn’t that good) we emerged back into the gift shop and sunlight. We were given a free sample of the cassis liquor made from red currants that Burgundy is famous for. We bought some of that because it was AMAZING and the sales woman told us you could pour it over pancakes. Is it said that I’m willing to risk my soul for boozy pancakes? I think it might be.

And with that, we were allowed to exit the gates

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId110.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190123/imagerId110.jpg)

Freedom! All joking aside, the cellars really were beautiful, and the tour and tasting is relatively inexpensive, so if you like wine and ever in Beaune it is probably worth your time.

More pics of Beaune as we wandered back to the car.

I think that you can see in the pictures that the sky was changing very quickly from sun to clouds and back to sun. It made for some incredibly varied pictures.

We got the car and made way out of Beaune, as we had one more stop to make in Burgundy before journeying back to our home base of Dijon. 

The was a wine cave that advertised tours with truffle sniffing dogs. I emailed them thinking that sounded amazing, but January is not truffle season. We dropped by anyway to try some wine, and see if we could meet the dogs.

We didn’t have an appointment, but a very sweet woman let us in and did a tasting for us. I’m actually not a huge wine drinker, but this stuff was pretty good.

We heard the dogs barking on the other side of the wall, but were too shy to directly ask the woman if we could meet them. Why are we so awkward?!?

We then hit the road for Dijon, driving by lots of other beautiful vineyards and villages

And back into Dijon. 

We dropped off the rental car, and walked back to our AirBnB. On the way we found a park with a polar bear

And a beautiful shopping street

We found a shop that sells a famous spice break made in Burgundy. This one happened to be in the shape of an owl, but it’s usually in a regular break loaf.

We also bought a cookie version with icing

We had planned to do a mustard tasting because it seemed like something you should do in Dijon, but we walked in the mustard store and I immediately felt sick to stomach. We hustled back to our place so I could huddle on the bed feeling sick for a while. Mustard really isn’t my thing. I thought I was going to need to stay in, and Jimmy and I were making plans for him to pick up crepes, but I decided to drink some water and eat a part of a baguette, and like magic I started to feel better. Apparently I was hungry or dehydrated. Or mustard is just really the worst. 

We had lovely traditional and homey Burgundian cooking the night before, so we decided to try the fancy version tonight. We went to one of the most highly rated restaurants in Dijon, ordered a surprise tasting menu, and ate really well.

To see food pics, you can visit Jimmy’s Instagram page James_is_Cooking. I’m getting tired and am trying to hurry this post along.

Dessert is worth taking time for

After that it was time to wander back to our place and head to bed. Which I’m going to do right now.

Good night.
