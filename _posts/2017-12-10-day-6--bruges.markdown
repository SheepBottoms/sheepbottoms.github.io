Ah, Bruges. Today we were lucky enough to wake up in a lovely hotel, located in a lovely 400 year old building, with a lovely breakfast, and a lovely bathtub. Lovely.



We then got to hit the streets, and slow down our pace a bit as we explored the historic and magical city of Bruges. First things first: a bit about Bruges. Bruges is a city in the Flanders region of Belgium, which actually has two names. The French name is Bruges, but the Flemish name is Brugge. Most people call the city Bruges (including English speakers) so that’s what I’ll call it for now. Belgium is split between the southern Walloon section that speaks French, and the northern Flemish sections which speaks Flemish (which is the same as Dutch, but with a slightly different accent). Bruges is in the Flemish section, so most people there use Flemish as their first language, but everyone we met spoke many languages, including English.



When we got off the train I asked a cab driver if he spoke English and he laughed and stated, “You don’t have to ask around here. Everyone speaks English.” We heard a waitress move effortlessly from helping us in English, to speaking with a French couple in French, speaking Flemish to another employee, then move quickly into Spanish as a Spanish speaking family entered the tavern. The only time I heard a waiter state he did not speak a language was when a group of young men told him they were from Copenhagen and asked in English if he spoke Danish. He didn’t.



We spent the morning exploring the old city center and enjoying warm milk with honey and cinnamon. The city centered has basically been preserved as it was in it’s heyday in the 1600’s. Everything there is old, including the tourists. As we were walking around we noticed some young couples and families, but we mainly noticed retirees and the outright elderly in walkers.  I kept hearing tour guides stated that it is known as the Venice of the North, because of the way the city center has been historically preserved, and all of the little canals that run throughout it. In the middle of the historic center is a square known as Grote Markt. At this time of year it fills up with a Christmas market. Here are some pics from the daytime.

They had horse drawn buggies carting tourists around all day. Here’s on with some ear warmers.

Notice the stormy clouds? It was incredibly rainy and windy that day, but we did our best. In the center of the square was an ice rink for ice skating, but it was open air and very wet.

We were pretty cold, so we wandered around in search of a warm beverage. Here are some pics from our wandering.

We ended up at a great place recommended by the owner of the hotel’s teenage daughter. Even in Belgium we’ve got a furry friend giving us the begging looks.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId14.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId14.jpg)



It was pretty tasty.

Then back to wandering town.

We grabbed lunch in a tavern, and Jimmy enjoyed some Belgium beer. I enjoyed pumpkin soup with goat cheese. It was delightful.

We then started the Rick Steves walking tour of Bruges. It was lovely, but we noticed we were following all of the guided tours. A cab driver told us that they bus in most of the tourists from tour buses or cruise ships. She said since we were there two nights we were practically locals. Most people just come for the day.

In it’s hayday Bruges was a major merchant city. It has a series of canals that used to connect the city. Now they are just lovely.

We followed the RS walking tour to the Groeninge Museum to visit some Flemish art. We arrived just as a group of about 40 people on a tour bus got there. The art was fun to see, but the audio guide was REALLY boring. If you go, skip it. We did, however, learn a lot about Flemish primitives. For example, they are called primitives because they are painted in a two dimensional format. Here’s an example:



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId28.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId28.jpg)



They pretty much all looked like this one. They had a lot of portraits of important people in Bruges history, but unless you are really into that it was super boring. I think both Jimmy and I agreed that while it was fun to look at this style of art, the audio guide needed to edit what it saw as crucial or interesting information a bit more.



After visiting the museum, we decided to visit the Church of Our Lady, which is famous for having a Michelangelo stature of Mary and Jesus. The statue was very cool, but the lighting made it hard to get a good picture, so you’re just going to have to go visit it in person. Here are some pictures of the church:

By the time we left the church it was raining really hard, so we sought shelter in the Old Chocolate House. They have a chocolate shop on the bottom floor, and a chocolate café upstairs overlooking the old houses and cobblestones streets. In the café you could order any kind of hot chocolate imaginable, as well as a thin variation of the classic Belgian waffle.



Here was some of their specials:



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId36.jpg)



I got the Winnie the Pooh, and they brought out a cup of steaming hot milk and a small chocolate shell filled with the other ingredients, including real honey comb and lavender. Here’s what it looked like before mixing in the ingredients:

Hot chocolate in Belgium also always comes with a shortbread. In the background you can see Jimmy’s Tiramisu hot chocolate. Here’s a better pic of his:



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId39.jpg)



When I mixed mine together, this is what it looked like.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId40.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId40.jpg)



And this is how big it was.

And here’s the fancy waffle

In the shop we came across a furry critter begging for chocolate. His expression was so much like our furry critter.

After getting some chocolate to bring home, we were ready to hit the streets for the Christmas market. The rain continued.

On every trip we take together, Jimmy and I pick out a Christmas ornament to commemorate the trip. As we’ve traveled more, our tree at home has started to fill up with the all of the places we’ve been and the adventures we’ve had together. I love our tradition. We found our Belgian ornament here at this Christmas market. I stopped in at a stall that was full of little handmade gnomes all decked out for Christmas. They are so ugly, but they are also so adorable, and the lady at the stall handmade all of them. I can’t help but picture her at home making thousands of Christmas gnomes (because there were at least a thousand there.) It was a tough choice, but I picked my favorite. If you want to see it, you’ll have to come visit at Christmas time and check out our tree.



Our last mission in Bruges was to climb the bell tower to get city views of the lights for Christmas. It was one of the more difficult tower climbs we’ve done, made even harder because there is only one way up and down, and the stairs are very narrow. The view at the tops was a bit disappointing, but we got this one of the markt from halfway up.

Through a small hole in a window on the way down.

We again got cold and wet, and ducked into a tavern to do a beer tasting before dinner.



Voila!



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId57.jpg)



Now I know this post is super long, but we do have to talk about dinner our second night in Bruges. I had done some research, and waned to find something that would be pretty unique. In my research I stumbled upon a place called the Pigeon House. They serve . . . pigeon. 



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId58.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId58.jpg)



Yep, that. But it doesn’t look like that when they serve it, it looks like this:



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId59.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171207/imagerId59.jpg)



It’s actually pretty good, but it spawned a bunch of conspiracy theories about where the pigeons come from, and a lovely rendition of “feed the birds” on the way back to hotel. The restaurant has seating in it’s amazing cellar with exposed wood beams, stone, and brick, making it a lovely setting. The waiter was great. He greeted us at the door, and asked us walk down the stairs behind us. He did not follow, but when we got down there we looked up and BAM! There he was. We had a lot of theories about that magic trick for a while (I honestly thought he might be twins for a while), but when I got up to use the bathroom I saw that there were hidden stairs behind the bar. Sneaky, sneaky.



Here’s a few more random pics to end the post. They got out of order and I’m too lazy right now to put them back.



Good night!
