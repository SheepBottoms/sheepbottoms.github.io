Awww. Very busy day has made me very sleepy, but it‚Äôs actually only 9:30 so I‚Äôm going to get this blog done before bed. So far, I‚Äôve gotten the blog done each evening, and haven‚Äôt fallen behind. Yay me! I have to enjoy my moment now, because I have a feeling this is all going to fall apart in Disneyland.

We began the day with an incredibly hearty breakfast at a place in OB called Jake & Eggs. It‚Äôs a pop up restaurant embedded in an Indian restaurant. Most of the time the place is called Sundara Indian Cuisine, but Wednesday through Sunday from 8am-1pm it becomes an amazing homestyle breakfast place.

Guys, it‚Äôs good. I got the French toast with seasonal fruit, and the add on option of bacon and eggs. When my food arrived, Jimmy hinted that I may have ordered too much, but don‚Äôt worry, I finished it all. 

After grabbing a hearty breakfast, we headed over the very ritzy La Jolla neighborhood. We noticed the vibe quickly went from beach bum, to ocean yuppie. La Jolla is famous for expensive boutiques and fancy resorts, but it is most famous for the La Jolla caves and snorkeling at La Jolla cove. We didn‚Äôt have time for snorkeling on this trip, but we did take a kayaking tour to the caves.

Often you can kayak through some of the caves, but it was big surf day today, so the lifeguard service closed access to the caves. Instead, we just kayaked out and learned about the fancy houses on the water (Dr. Suess hung out at one), and learned a bit about the history of the caves (spoiler: it was a prohibition hot spot). 

Jimmy and I decided to do a two person kayak, which was . . .challenging. We struggled to paddle together.

Jimmy suited up and ready:

One of our guides talking about the caves with the caves in the background

Since we couldn‚Äôt go through the caves, the guide gave us some time to swim around in the water. I was meeting up with a friend so I decided I wanted to stay dry, but Jimmy dove right in.

Most of the tour was pretty chill, but due to the size of the surf swells, paddling out and paddling was pretty exciting. On the way out, Jimmy and I managed just fine with the help of a ‚Äúbeach hand‚Äù whose job was to hang on to the back of the kayak to push the back down when going over a swell so you don‚Äôt capsize. A few members of our tour and one of our guides got dunked on the way out. 

On the way in, our guide gave us the option of having a beach helper make sure we got back in without capsizing, or catching a wave and riding it in. Jimmy wanted to catch a wave, but I wanted the helper. Unfortunately, the helped came to the back of the boat where Jimmy was sitting, and the surf was too loud for me to hear what they were saying, so the beach helper waited until we were the last ones left to go in and helped us catch a huge wave. Jimmy didn‚Äôt lock his feet and force his weight backwards, so as we crested the wave he flew forward and pushed me out of the kayak. I thought we had capsized, but when I got up and wiped off my eyes, I saw Jimmy still happily sitting in the kayak. Figures.

He made up for it by finding me some amazing tacos. Man, I‚Äôm going to miss San Diego and it‚Äôs tacos.

After tacos it was time to get cleaned up, and head to Balboa Park where I was getting to meet up with my friend, Piper. I don‚Äôt know if even Piper knows this, but she was the first friend I made when I came to college at Point Loma (well, now she knows because she told me she‚Äôs reading the blogüòä). When I first moved down I was living in a house with a family from the local church off campus. Not being in the dorm as a freshman made it really hard to make friends, especially since I‚Äôm not particularly outgoing and didn‚Äôt know anyone else at my school. I met Piper in my theatre class, and she was so kind to me. She has an amazing life with a beautiful family here now, so it was amazing to catch up with her after so many years.

Before Piper got there, we took a selfie

Here‚Äôs Piper:

Piper and I wandered around the Park, visiting the lily pond, orchid garden, and having lemonade and dessert in an outdoor museum caf√©.

If you‚Äôve never been to Balboa Park, it‚Äôs a beautiful park and walkway with fountains, gardens, museums, and a Globe theatre replica. It‚Äôs incredibly beautiful.

While Piper and I were catching up, Jimmy found a Bird scooter, and did some scootering around the park. He said that eventually he found a nice tree to sit under and practiced French. I took him there so he could spend time in the museums, but I guess museums just aren‚Äôt the same without me.

Eventually it was time to meet back up with Jimmy, and Piper was awesome and took a rare pic of me and Jimmy that isn‚Äôt a selfie.

After Piper left, Jimmy and I decided to wander down the park in search of an old favorite place of mine called Extraordinary Desserts. Yep, they do amazing desserts. I mean, extraordinary.

Wandering by the pond

We wandered over a bridge with a beautiful view of some buildings

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180916/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180916/imagerId35.jpg)

And found a cool tree for Jimmy to hang out in

25 minutes later, we were at Extraordinary Desserts

Eating this

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180916/imagerId38.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180916/imagerId38.jpg)

When we first arrived the place was pretty empty, but a little while after we got our dessert it began to get really crowded with people who were even more clearly tourists than we were. Waiting in the line for the bathroom, Jimmy was told by a tour driver that it was a tour group from Cambodia. They seemed like they needed all the space, so we took and headed back for our car.

The walk there seemed a bit long, so we hopped on some scooters to head back.

 As we were scootering back, the sun started to set.

I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the scooters at first, but I‚Äôve got to admit that my dress looks pretty cute while scootering.

A couple of more fountain pics

I had been planning to go to a place called Miguels in Point Loma on our last night, as I remembered it being the most amazing Mexican food from college. A frank question to Piper: 

Me: Is Miguel‚Äôs really as good as I remember it? 

Piper: No

She admitted that their cheesy white sauce is amazing with chips, but that really their food isn‚Äôt very good. She recommended that instead we go have some fun eating Mexican food in Sand Diego‚Äôs Old Town area and visit the shops there. It was great advice.

Dinner was solid, and we really enjoyed the live music and cute shops. We even got a new Christmas ornament here, as is our traveling tradition.

We considered enjoying the fiesta all night, but it‚Äôs a Sunday night so everything got packed up at 9pm. Which is just in time for our usual bed time.

Good night.
