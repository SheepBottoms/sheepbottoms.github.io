A new day, a new neighborhood. Or a couple of new neighborhoods. Today was our day for exploring historic Paris with the help of Mr. Steves. By the way, if Melissa Ibarra is reading this, I can‚Äôt get out of my head that your brother calls him Rick Stevies, and now I say it that way too without thinking about it. Problems.



Rick Stevies . . . er Steves recommends getting to Notre Dame early to avoid major crowds for touring the church and towers. We accidently slept in a bit, then we stopped into a caf√© for breakfast, so we missed seeing the inside early, and rolled up just in time for them to open the line to go to the top of the tower and hang with the gargoyles. RS didn‚Äôt mention this in his book, but they actually have kiosks near where the line forms where you can buy tickets for certain times. We got our ticket, and were able to enter right away.



Now before you read the section about the tower climb, you need to do me a little favor. You have to find the soundtrack to Disney‚Äôs Hunchback of Notre Dame. Seriously. Get on spotify, grab your CD, DVD, or VHS, and listen to the opening song ‚ÄúThe Bells of Notre Dame‚Äù. I‚Äôll wait. I‚Äôm giving that advice because that is what I did when I was climbing the tower steps. I popped in my ear buds and drowned out the sound of a group of giggling Italian teenagers. I wasn‚Äôt worried about being a tacky tourist in a sacred place because they were totally selling Victor Hugo‚Äôs book in the gift shop. Close enough, right?



It was epic. 



The top of the tower was incredible. We were right in line with the gargoyles (continue Hunchback music. Just trust me).

Obligatory picture from the top. There was netting and bars all around . . . you know for the gargoyles protection.

One gargoyle chewing on another gargoyle. Like our dog with a bone. Or our cat‚Äôs head.

At one point we got to go in the bell tower, and Jimmy was horrified to learn that the structure was made of some very sketchy wood. Here‚Äôs an old bell.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId9.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId9.jpg)



The bells rang while we were up at the top, and they were intensely loud. At that point I turned off the Disney music and listened to the actual bells of Notre Dame.

Ok, just a few more gargoyle pics and then we‚Äôll move on. It‚Äôs just that they were sooooo cool!

One last pic of me and Jimmy.

After that we climbed down, and discovered a mob of people in front of the cathedral. I asked a teenager to take a picture of us with the Cathedral . . .



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId17.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId17.jpg)



He missed. He missed the Cathedral. Seriously, it was like I asked him to take a pic of us in front of the giant line of tourists. Lame.



I got one of Jimmy

And a selfie

And then found an adult to take one of the two of us.

We decided to go ahead with the Rick Steve‚Äôs walk, and visit the inside of the Cathedral closer to closing time after the crowds had died down. We walked around the park behind the Cathedral, and across the Sein to the Ile Saint-Louis island.

Which full of very classic French cafes 



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId28.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId28.jpg)



At that point, it was time to take a break from the historic Paris walk, and head into the Bastille district for lunch at a very trendy restaurant called Septime. They open reservations for two weeks before any given date, and they are usually gone within hours if not minutes. Between the two of us, Jimmy and I were able to get one for lunch.



The restaurant isn‚Äôt labeled on the outside, because if you don‚Äôt already know where the Paris hipster places are, no one‚Äôs going to tell you. Just kidding. They were actually very lovely. It‚Äôs the blue buiding.

We were served a five course set menu which included two starters, an entr√©e, a dessert, and cheese plate. It was all amazing. It made me think of my two biggest foodie friends, Stephanie Hepburn and Melissa Douglas. Shout out if you ladies are reading this üòä

After that, it was back to walk. Here‚Äôs Jimmy listening to the audio guide.

I found my bookstore home in Paris just like all the great English speaking artists do at Shakespeare and Company.

And we attempted to go to Cluny museum, which is turns out is closed on Tuesdays. Odd.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId36.jpg)



We then wandered over to enjoy the beautiful stained glass of Sainte-Chapelle

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171205/imagerId39.jpg)



And visited the Conciergerie, which was kind of like France‚Äôs tower of London. It‚Äôs not famous as the place where Marie Antionette was imprisoned, and I think where she was executed via Guillotine. I don‚Äôt know. So much history. It‚Äôs all kind of a blur now.



After that we headed back to the Notre Dame to enjoy the evening lights and tour the inside. The crowds had indeed died down and there was no wait to get in.

We ended our day with dinner, and continued wandering of the city at night. The city is lovely at night, but I have to say that I was disappointed by the lack of Christmas lights. Our Europe trip last Christmas was so full of Christmas sparkle, but maybe it‚Äôs too early in Paris. Here are some night pics.

Tomorrow we‚Äôre spending most of the day in Paris, then heading off to Belgium, where I hear they are big on Christmas sparkle. Can‚Äôt wait!



Good night.
