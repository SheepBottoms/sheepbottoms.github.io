Day 8! We made it! If you’ve read our blogs from previous trips, you know that Jimmy and I have a habit of getting sick on every trip. We’ve tried lots of things in an effort to avoid this, but it always seems to hit anyway.

Before going on this trip, we decided to do a little experiment to see if we could get some data on possibilities for avoiding illness. Jimmy decided to chug Airborne like there’s no tomorrow, and I decided to try Zicam to see if it would work better. I was actually pretty optimistic about my ability to stay healthy, because I had great success in avoiding illness on our trip to France/Belgium in December, and also with my trip to Puerto Rico with my friend, Wendy, in February. I had made it this far, and with two days left before our travel day I thought I had made it.

I hadn’t. I woke up this morning with a terrible sore throat. Jimmy continued to be sick, so I once again scrapped my preplanned activities, and reorganized the day around getting some more rest. Our original plan was to get up at 6am, take a train to Hemji, and visit the incredible Hemji castle and Samuri village. We woke up at 9am, and instead decided to head to the Arashiyama neighborhood of Kyoto which is famous for beautiful gardens, a bamboo forest, a monkey park, and one of the most exciting trolley stations in Japan. 

After visiting Arashiyama, our plan was to head north 45 minutes to visit Kinkakuji also known as the Golden Pavilion and is one of the most beautiful and famous Buddhist temples in the world. 

Due to not feeling well, I woke up slightly grouchy and demanded, and refused to eat another breakfast of fish. Instead, I had done some research the night before and had a plan to go to Kyoto’s version of a French café. I got excited about them because they advertised “French style coffee and pastries” including house made peanut butter.

Now, I’ve been to France and never once had peanut butter served to me in café (someone prove me wrong, but I don’t think the French do peanut butter), but as an American I love peanut butter so this place was calling me. 

Jimmy and I have an ongoing dialogue going about how when we travel to different countries, if we go to places that serve what people consider to be traditional foods from that country, we end up eating with a bunch of tourists. When we go to places that serve “international types of food” (and generally when we find fast food) we find the locals. That was true of this café. We saw more local people in this café than any other restaurant in Japan. We also LOVED Japan’s take on a French café. Like all of us when we try to copy other cultures, it was a little less than authentic. It made me think of when I was in college in Northern Idaho and took a friend from Hong Kong to a local “Chinese” restaurant. Her response was “How can you eat this stuff?” followed by “It’s not really Chinese”. 

Here’s the traditional French café in Kyoto:

Now I want to make it clear: this place was amazing. Just because it wasn’t strictly authentic, doesn’t mean I didn’t love every minute of being there. Here’s my amazing toast with house made peanut butter and grilled bananas:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId7.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId7.jpg)

I really think Heaven will be eating this toast all the time. The coffee was also great, and they gave me that little canister of simple syrup for my iced coffee. Such a great idea!

Jimmy got what looked like a lovely English breakfast with toast, eggs, sausage, and other things, then we hit the trolley. I guess I didn’t get a good picture of it, but the “train” to Arashiyama is actually a really adorable trolley. 

Which is fitting, because the neighborhood is also really adorable. We started our adventure by visiting TenryuJi Temple, which is famous as a World Heritage site and has beautiful gardens.

All the pictures you’ve seen so far are just the entrance to the temple gardens. We’re note even in the official gardens yet. As you can tell, lots of pictures in this post.

One of this temple’s claims to fame (aside from the gardens) is a ceiling mural of a dragon that is in this building:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId26.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId26.jpg)

The dragon is famous for having “moving eyes”. It’s eyes don’t really move, but wherever you stand in the room it appears as if the dragon is looking at you. We decided this sounded awesome, and arrived just in time for an informational presentation by the monks about the painting. Unfortunately the person selling us the ticket didn’t mention that the presentation was only in Japanese. It was still cool to see, but no pictures allowed so you’ll have to go see it for yourself. 

You can pay to go inside the temple, but we decided we’d already seen a few temples, and so instead we opted for a cheaper ticket that only involved visiting the gardens. Here’s the main temple building:

So, at the monkey park Jimmy discovered some cool things about the settings on his camera phone. At this stage in the trip he became pretty artsy about his photos, so get ready for some cool ones.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId40.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId40.jpg)

Basically he got really into the background blurring effect. I’m now combing through tons of pics of me in the foreground with the background blurred. I’m moving on back to scenery pics for now, but you can look our for more of Jimmy’s artistic photos throughout the next couple of posts.

Ok, so admittedly, we got there later than we meant to and we weren’t alone. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId42.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId42.jpg)

By this point we were getting pretty used to crowds, and it didn’t feel like a big deal to us.

That last one was of me and another tourists taking awkward pics of each other taking pictures. Which means that each accidentally ruined each other’s picture. Sorry.

There were a lot of people near the temple, but as we climbed up the hillside we found a bit more solitude and some lovely views.

Ok, there was an Australian mom with her two sons (ages looking about 6 and 8) in tow, and we kept running into them. This mom was determined to get epic pictures of her kids at all the beautiful spots, but the kids were significantly less interested in this than she was. So basically, she had her kids stand in front of all the beautiful spots and took forever trying to coax them to smile or do some elaborate pose, which meant that everyone else had to wait to get their own pics, or just to have a moment to enjoy the beauty of the spot. Good on her for being there alone with two boys, and I hope she got some pics that made it worth it.

This was one of those spots:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId63.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId63.jpg)

We exited the temple into the bamboo forest

Gotta love the magic of photography. I took that first one, which looks like we’re in the middle of the forest alone. Here’s the more realistic one Jimmy took.

We were not alone. It was actually so crowded it was hard to walk through. But it was still beautiful.

At the end of the bamboo forest is an estate that was built by a Japanese actor in the 1920’s, and when he died it was opened up for touring. You can’t go in the buildings, but the grounds are amazing.

Your ticket to enter the estate comes with a free tea at the teahouse on the grounds. It was perfect timing as we had been walking a while and were looking for a break.

The teahouse had a beautiful view onto the forested garden

We had a lovely young couple take this pic. I don’t know why, but we super awkward about asking them. We were feeling weird and hesitant, and they were very nice. After feeling so weird, we ended up accidently following them for most of our time on the estate.

A big thing to do in Kyoto is to go to places where you can rent kimonos and have your hair and makeup professionally done. People would then wander around all the tourists attractions and take pictures dressed up. I’m sure the pictures were amazing, but it would be so hard to walk those! Spoiler, we didn’t do the kimono thing. 

We made our way back to the train station, passing by shrines and souvenir shops along the way.

Umbrellas are a big deal in any weather in Japan. Obviously people carry them to keep dry in the rain, but we also saw a lot of umbrellas keeping the sun off of people in the nice weather.

We grabbed some food at the stands at the trolley station. I got dumplings, and Jimmy got some soup.

And even had an onsen (hut tub) for your feet.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId116.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId116.jpg)

I peeked in, but felt weird taking pictures of people soaking their feet, so I didn’t. 

On the trolley Jimmy and I decided that we ere tired, and didn’t feel we had the time or energy to head all the way to the Golden Pavilion, so in lieu of going to Hemji castle, we decided to visit Nijo castle in Kyoto. I hadn’t heard that much about it, so I didn’t expect much, but it was really cool.

As an aside, there was a cool samurai sword store across the street.

It also had a moat, with vending machines where you could buy food to feed the koi fish in the moat.

At that point it was time to go rest before our evening activity of a traditional Kaiseki dinner with a performance and meet and greet with a Geisha. My phone had been having trouble holding a charge the whole trip, and at one point in the castle I was wandering around like a total nerd with my phone plugged into my portable charger (which I had to hold in my hand because for some reason my phone needed to be at just the right angle to actually charge). At that point I gave up on my phone, so all the ongoing pictures are from Jimmy’s phone.

The Geisha dinner was in the Gion district of Kyoto, which is the old part of the city where the historic inns and teahouses are. It’s famous for it’s atmospheric small and windy streets. More on that later. On the way there we wandered by this awesome shrine.

Here’s the street our dinner was on

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId153.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId153.jpg)

It was at a ryokan in Gion

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId155.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId155.jpg)

The dinner presentation was very nice, and we were placed at a table with another English speaking couple. He was from England, and she was from Estonia. Our first case came in this cute little box.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId156.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId156.jpg)

I didn’t realize that the top part of this box also contained little, carefully presented appetizers, so I turned the lid upside spilling all of my food all over the table. Awkward.  The servers and our table buddies were very nice about it. One of our buddies offered to also spill his box so I didn’t feel like such an idiot. He was surprised when I attempted to take him up on his offer, and didn’t follow through.

Our food

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId157.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId157.jpg)

So, though dinner was beautifully presented, the actual food was . . . just ok. Halfway through the Geiko (Geisha) entered, and out on a music and dance and performance.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId158.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId158.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId159.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId159.jpg)

After the Geiko’s performance, they introduced a Meiko (Geisha in training) and taught us about the differences between them, and the type of training young women go through to become a Geiko (spoiler, it takes like 6 years). 

You can tell the difference between a Geiko and Meiko because a Geiko will have her bustle rolled up, and will be wearing a wig. A Meiko wears hers loose and wears her natural hair.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId160.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId160.jpg)

A Meiko’s sleeves are also longer

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId161.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId161.jpg)

Geiko’s can be any age (the one in the green dress told us there is a Geiko in Kyoto in her 80’s), but Meiko’s are usually under 20 years old. They all looked really young to me.

It was neat to learn about this Japanese cultural tradition, and I feel awful saying this, but I didn’t really get it. I know the music and dance moves are steeped in tradition and are probably very technical, but it was very simple and understated, and I felt like I didn’t get a sense of the skills these women have spent 6 years learning. I still feel like I don’t know what they are, or, more importantly, why they are. 

After their performance, we got the opportunity to ask questions to one of them through an interpreter. We had less than 5 minutes to ask this woman a few questions, which included the process of applying to become and Geiko and her favorite skills. She was lovely, and let’s be honest, her dress was killer.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId162.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId162.jpg)

After picture taking and talking, we played a traditional Geiko drinking game. If you lost, you had to drink some beer, if you won, you got a prize from the Geiko. They chose one person from each table to play, and I was the lucky voluntold player at my table.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId163.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId163.jpg)

I was one of two people to beat the Geiko and get a prize

Everyone at our table got the chance to play a game, except Jimmy who needed to use the restroom at just the right moment and escaped the room before he could be volunteered. 

We then took another picture with the Geiko and Meiko

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId165.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId165.jpg)



The woman on the end without the makeup was not a geiko or meiko, she was the interpreter who explained the events of the evening in both Japanese and English.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId166.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId166.jpg)

I have to be honest, I know a lot of people love the dinners with geiko, and they are expensive enough to feel slightly exclusive, but I felt uncomfortable the whole night and didn’t really understand who those women why or how they end up in the geisha houses. I thought maybe I just feeling residual discomfort from my incident of spilling my food (it takes me some time to bounce back from embarrassment like that), but when we left Jimmy said he felt really uncomfortable too. I don’t know what it was, but there was just a weird feeling. It may have been that there was an older Japanese man at the table next to us who was clearly a regular and had a book of pictures of all the geiko in Japan. It was just strange to see how this man treated these young women and to wonder if this is their experience at most performances. 

I’m not writing off geikos or meikos, and I think I respect the dedication they have to their craft, I’m just being honest that this experience didn’t present what they do in a way that gave me any deeper understanding. 

We left the dinner, and wandered back by the same shrine we saw on our way there, but this time we saw it all lit up at night. It was beautiful.

We then wandered the lit up streets of the Gion district for a romantic stroll

As we were wandering down a small lane, I noticed a young woman wandering in front of us. Jimmy and I proceeded to bicker about whether she was a Geisha, or just a woman in a kimono.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId175.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/20/imagerId175.jpg)

We kept wandering, and ran into some women up ahead who were speaking English to each other. I asked if a Geisha had just walked by. They excitedly announced that one had, and they were very excited because they were “Geisha hunting.” They said it was a popular tourist activity in Kyoto, where you wander the small lanes in Gion and wait for Geisha to walk by on their way from their cabs to the teahouses where they entertain private guests. If you don’t pay for a dinner or have access to the special teahouses (you have to be introduced by current members like a private club), then this is the only way to see Geisha. We watched a couple more young geishas walk by, and laughed at the lengths that some tourists went to such as following them around and running after them.

After spending about 15 minutes talking with the women, we wandered back home and went to bed. Here’s a lovely view of our walk home.
