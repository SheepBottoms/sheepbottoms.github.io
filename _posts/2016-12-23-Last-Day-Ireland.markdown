Oh, Ireland, we love you and shall miss you so! Today was our last full day on the Emerald Isle.

We knew we were going to have to drive from Derry back to Belfast today, because our plane leaves from Belfast for England tomorrow. I may have inadvertently indicated that the Dark Hedges (which became famous thanks to Game of Thrones) were right on our way back to Belfast. Actually, they were quite indirectly on our way, but I figured it was all close enough.

It was funny, when we were wandering around Derry the day before, everyone had been saying “Terrible weather today. It’s supposed to be even worse tomorrow.” 

They were right. It was horribly windy, with hard, driving rain. Did that deter us. No! We drove our way down tiny little country roads straight to the Dark Hedges. We were, obviously, the only ones there in the ridiculous weather conditions, so we grabbed what I can only describe as a truly heroic backpacking tripod, set it up in the middle of the road, and took some pictures.

We felt like rock stars. You can see that the light is very grey and hazy.

After the first set of pictures, we took a break to read the plaques. The first one was about Game of Thrones.

The second was about a ghost called “the Grey Lady” who is supposed to haunt the road. It was feeling pretty grey today . . .

We regrouped a bit, and drove to the other end of the hedges. The light on that side was much better.

We found this fun knotted tree that we thought Jimmy’s Grandma June might think was interesting.

Again, our tripod was set up in the dead middle of the street, because there was no one else there.

After a few minutes another car pulls up, and a group of a few other people come out to take pictures. One man exclaims, “This is amazing! You guys picked an amazing day.” We thought he was teasing us because of the terrible weather, but he stated, “normally this road is filled with coaches and tour groups so you can’t take any nice looking pictures. Look how clear it is today! Perfect!.” 

Happy to have someone show up to relieve our poor tripod, which had stood firm despite the strong wind, we asked the gentleman to take a picture of us.

Every picture he took was blurry, and we really wish we had just stuck with the tripod.

We had lunch at The Hedges Hotel restaurant, which was fine but odd because we were also the only people there.

We were supposed to then head to the Fairy Glens and hike in Glenariff forest, but the weather was so bad that we decided to be total nubs and head to CarrickFergus Castle instead. 
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161223/image13.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161223/image13.jpeg)

It actually wasn’t such a bad choice. The castle was pretty cool and is located right on the harbor.

Which apparently means there are pirates. Can’t go wrong with that.

The weather cleared up for an hour so as we toured the castle, but we were still one of only three couples there. When we first entered the castle we were the only ones there. Can I just say, traveling to Ireland in the winter is kind of the bomb.

Parts of the castle was set up with mannequins to look like they were acting out scenes. Seriously, what is with the Irish and mannequins? They honestly creep me out a bit.

Also, more cannons. Cause we all know Jimmy loves a good cannon.

This pigeon is an inside joke. We descended to what felt like a dungeon and this pigeon flew up. I’ve never seen Jimmy jump so high.

You could walk up to the top of one of the towers which had gorgeous views.

And, of course, they had what now appears to us to be a mandatory mannequin on the toilet.

This one didn’t have sounds effects, but he was labeled as “King John” . . . sitting on the John. Yuk yuk.

The last part was kind of strange for me. I’m not usually afraid of heights, and I don’t easily get vertigo. That’s Jimmy’s cross to bare, but some reason these tiny, steep stairs down from the tallest tower really freaked me out. I was working my DBT coping skills and failing pretty miserably.

But in the end it was all worth it. It was a pretty fun castle/museum/tourist trap.

Our last big Shabang in Ireland (other than sleeping and going to airport) was going to dinner in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter. If you get a chance to go there, it’s really pretty fun.

We ate dinner at The Cloth Ear (no idea what that name means), and I got a lovely tower of turkey, ham, and stuffing balls. Pretty amazing.

By the way, how creepy does Jimmy’s blurry face look in that pic? It looks like he has no face.

Aww, there he is. So handsome.
Good night from Ireland, for the final night.
