Final full day in Japan! Guys, we’re really sad, but also really tired, and there’s so much in Japan we haven’t gotten to experience yet, so we’ll just have to come back. 

Our last full day in Japan we are spending in Kyoto. Tomorrow our day will be spent hopping a train from Kyoto to Tokyo, then hopping an airplane home. We decided to avoid the urge to overdo our last day in Kyoto (mainly because my cold hit full force last night and I am sooooo tired), so we’re focusing on three main things: 

Visiting Fushimi Inari Taisha, which is a Shinto shrine famous for having literally thousands of vermillion torii gates that span over a beautiful hillside in the morning.

Spending the afternoon visiting Kinkakuji, or the golden pavilion which is on the other side of Kyoto from Fushimi Inari. 

Finding sushi. Jimmy and I realized we haven’t been to a sushi train place our whole time in Japan. Jimmy admitted he’s never been to one, so we decided to fix that with a recommended place from Lonely Planet.

First things first, we went back to the café with the amazing peanut butter toast. I know, lame. We try to find new spots and try new things all the time when we travel, but it was such comfort food and we were so tired this morning. And it was AMAZING.

After breakfast we caught a very busy metro to the shrine. When we pulled into the station, we saw that it was jam packed with people, making it the busiest landmark we’d been to in Japan yet. We’re pretty used to crowds and didn’t mind it, but if you don’t want to be shuffled through with tons of people, you should go at opening or closing time.

This is what the entrance looked like from the station:

Not only is the shrine giant and an amazing, vibrant color, but it’s patron is all of the cute foxes. They had these statues all over the shrine, and some of them had different things in their mouths. I loved them.

Although the initial shrine through the entrance is beautiful, the showstopper here are the vermillion torii (or tall gates) that line areas all over the hillside. You walk through them, and along the way are many more smaller shrines and even some cemeteries. Even with all the people, it was pretty amazing, and as we climbed the hillside, the crowds thinned out.

We wandered up a small path leading up the hillside to a bamboo forest. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId32.jpg)

We saw some little dummies (who were not Japanese) carving something into the bamboo. Why do people think it’s ok to do this?

Back at the bottom of the shrine there was a beautiful pond.

We wandered back out of the shrine, and took the metro back to Kyoto station. We decided to grab some beef cutlets at a restaurant that had been recommended to us on the eleventh floor of Kyoto station. Yep, eleventh floor. Because Kyoto station is huge.

Here’s the views on our way up:

There was some kind of a jazz band festival going on. It was pretty fun.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId55.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId55.jpg)

The beef cutlets were amazing! Fully cooked and not fish. Also, the view from the restaurant was pretty cool.

From Kyoto station we hopped a train to Kinkakuji, and then, because we were tired and lazy, we took a cab to the pavilion.

The first thing we noticed about the pavilion: they were serving ice cream near the entrance. Memo to self: stop for ice cream before leaving.

Here’s the beautiful Golden Pavilion:

At the pavilion, you follow a predetermined track that takes you around the outside and through the garden. It was beautiful, but I was kind of disappointed we couldn’t get inside.

For the record, I don’t edit any pictures in the blog. They all look exactly as the camera takes them. I’m noticing with the Golden Pavilion, that each of our three cameras (Jimmy’s phone camera, my phone camera, and our little waterproof and travel friendly Nikon) makes the pictures look a bit different. On this particular day the Nikon was really highlighting the beautiful colors, where the phone cameras brought out pictures that are more muted n color. The picture above is from the Nikon, and those bright colors are more how I remember it. It was really gorgeous. Below is a similar pic from Jimmy’s phone camera.

After wandering the grounds, we headed out and stopped by the ice cream stand. Jimmy got some match ice cream, which was good, but I got this:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId73.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId73.jpg)

That is a shaved ice with a strawberry reduction syrup, condensed milk on top, some kind of yummy shavings of something, and the little gummy balls which I tried and then didn’t end up eating because they literally had no flavor. It was glorious.

We decided to take the bus back to the station rather than spending the money on a cab, which meant we rode the busiest bus I have ever been on. The busiest piece of public transport transportation we had ever been on was a light rail in Ghent in Belgium, where people were literally hanging on the outside, but this was pretty tight. We ended up in the very back of the bus because we’re nubes, but luckily a local business in the back needed the same stop we did and pushed everyone out of the way for us. Had he not done that, we might still be stuck on the bus.

Us having fun at the station:

We headed back to Kyoto station, and Jimmy agreed to hang in a coffee shop for a bit while I looked into a few of the shops below the station. I wandered around for a bit, and found some moisturizer called Steam Cream that smells AMAZING and works on your face, hands, body, and hair (so convenient), and then I wandered looking at the clothing shops. 

I have loved the fashion in Japan. Businessmen wear suits, and young men wear button up shirts and pants (they all looked good but not super exciting), but the women all look amazing. They wear these amazing midi skirts with lots of volume, super cute flowy culottes, and the cutest tops. They are very conservative, but very classy. They also all have elastic waistbands, which means a single pair of pants can fit multiple sizes of ladies. I’m going to let that sink in a minute. You can fluctuate weight by like 20 pounds, and still be able to wear the same clothes. Brilliant! I tried on some skirts, but let’s be honest, no one in Seattle wears that kind of thing, so I ended up not buying any. I know I’m going to regret it.

After a while of wandering, I had wandered into what clearly looked and felt like an underground mall, and realized I had been gone a while and had no idea where or how I was to get back to the station. Since I was underground, Googlemaps also had no idea how to get around. I texted Jimmy that I was trying to find him but super lost, and he texted me where he was. He then texted me that he wasn’t where he thought he was, and he was also lost. We spent about another 30 minutes both being lost, before we ended up together on the platform of the metro to the sushi place.

When we got to the sushi place, there was a line out the door, but we noticed it was moving fast and we felt determined, so we hopped in line. If you are like Jimmy and have never had a sushi train experience, it looks like this:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId76.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId76.jpg)

Everyone sits around the outside of a moving conveyor belt, and the chefs are in the middle making tons of different kinds of sushi. Once the sushi is made, they pop the plate on the conveyor belt, and you grab it and eat it when comes by if it looks good. You pay at the end based on how many plates are in front of you. It’s not high class sushi, but it’s pretty fun.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId78.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/21/imagerId78.jpg)

At about $1 a plate, it’s also pretty cheap. A long time ago, when we lived in Portland and I was doing community based work with Catholic Community Services, one of my clients was in love with sushi. For her graduation from services event, she wanted to go to one of those places and eat sushi, so we did. I don’t even like sushi very much, but this is fun. 

After dinner, we wandered back home and packed up our stuff for the next day of travel. Jimmy challenged my ability to fit my Duffy popcorn container from Disney Seas in my carryon luggage, so of course I rose to the challenge and he’s hanging in my backpack carrying all of my tea for me. Should I leave him behind? Yes. But because I’m stubborn, Duffy’s coming the US with us. 

Good night.
