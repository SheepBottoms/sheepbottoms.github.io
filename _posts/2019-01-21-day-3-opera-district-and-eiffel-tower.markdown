Hey friends. Another busy day in Paris has come and gone. For me the day started off at 2am, when both Jimmy and I found ourselves suddenly wide away. I tried to convince him to eat an apple tart we bought the day before at a bakery, but he took a Benadryl and went back to sleep. I tried to go back to sleep, but instead I tossed, turned, and posted on Instagram and Facebook until about 6:30, when I got up and decided to just go ahead and dig in to the tart. 

First of all, the packaging of the tart was awesome.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId6.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId6.jpg)

I grab a plate and knife, and dive right into cutting myself a slice of deliciousness. As I’m eating, I stumble upon something hard in tart. When I pull it out, this is what I find:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId7.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId7.jpg)

It’s a dude, a little dude, a little clay dude. I’m thinking to myself, well this strange, but I figure there must be something to it, so I start googling. I found out that the French celebrate Three Kings Day as the start of Epiphany on January 6th, and that what looked like an apple tart was actually a special dessert called Galette des Rois. In France, they eat this desserts at parties with friends (rather than alone in the dark at 6am), and that whoever finds the figurine gets to wear the special crown. It’s now making sense to me why the women in the shop was so insistent that Jimmy and I get a crown with our dessert, but didn’t offer crowns to anyone else. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId8.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId8.jpg)

Apparently it’s common to have a child sit under the table to randomly decide who gets the next piece, as everyone digs into their slice to see if they got the little dude. Not wanting to miss out on tradition, I put on the crown and ate my slice (in the dark, alone, at 6:30am). When Jimmy woke up, that’s how he found me. 

Together we finished off the rest of the tart (I promise it wasn’t that big), then hit the streets to find more dessert. We had planned to meet up with our friends mid-morning, but I saw on Instagram that they had hit the night a bit harder than we had, so I figured they might be late. We had an errand we needed to run anyway, but more on that later.

Another thing I found while internet hopping in the wee hours of the morning: apparently a street artist has been decorating buildings around Paris with Krakens, and one of them appeared at a bar where we’re staying.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId9.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId9.jpg)

I thought the bars name was Kraken, but nope, it’s just mystery street art. 

Jimmy and I headed to a place I had found on a blog called Fragments, where it was advertised they served good breakfast. It was a tiny little shop, but they were able to find a little spot for us.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId10.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId10.jpg)

It’s run by British expats, and has a British twist on a French breakfast. I got some amazing porridge (I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but it truly was wonderful, and Jimmy went healthy with yogurt and house-made granola. Somehow, we accidently ordered a million coffees as well. I meant to just get a cappuccino, but they kept brining more different types of coffee. Maybe somehow they knew we were from Seattle and wanted to make us feel at home.

After breakfast we hit the streets looking for . . . glass wear! I know, very exciting. One of us (no naming names) accidently broke one of the water glasses at our Airbnb the night before, so we wanted to replace it before leaving. The host told us we could find some glasses at the supermarket across the street, which sounded super easy. He was wrong. We ran all over the neighborhood looking for cheap glasses. Luckily, it was a gorgeous, sunny day, so we got some Paris with blue skies pics as we wandered. 

I’m writing this post on a train heading out of Paris, so I can officially post about where stayed at. Here’s our street sign.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId15.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId15.jpg)

And here’s some of the neighborhood:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId19.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId19.jpg)

Not sure if this is a mistranslation or intentional pun, but we loved it.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId20.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId20.jpg)

45 minutes later, we found a store with cheap glasses, and attempted the self checkout. This did not go well. After another 10 minutes, an employee had to come up help us out.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId21.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId21.jpg)

Around that time, my friends texted that they were on time, as well as this picture:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId22.jpg)

They had been wandering the Montmartre area near Sacre Coeur, and found a cat for me. We dropped the new glasses back off at our Airbnb and headed out to the Opera District to visit the Palais Garnier. The plan was to tour the beautiful interior, and do lunch and shopping in the surrounding neighborhood. 

We excited the metro station to this beautiful sight:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId23.jpg)

We were shocked that there were so many people there. I hadn’t expected it to be a popular attraction. I commented to Jimmy that none of the blogs or guidebooks mentioned it being so busy, and that I felt bad I hadn’t warned my friends.

Cool picture of the metro exit

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId24.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId24.jpg)

And the beautiful Opera Garnier exterior

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId26.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId26.jpg)

We tried to take a selfie, but with the sun in our faces we just looked angry. We both packed sunglasses on the trip, and we both left them at the bnb on our only sunny day in Paris. Hello crows feet.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId27.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId27.jpg)

When we got closer to the building, it became clear that it wasn’t just a normal crowd of tourists around the building, it was tourists with giant cameras and professional grade equipment. Guys, it was totally a hoard of paparazzi. I obviously have no personal experience with the paparazzi, so it was pretty fascinating to watch them. People would come out of the entrance in lovely clothes, and the paparazzi would run to snap photos and ask them questions. Being the little dummies we are, Jimmy and I had no idea who the people were or why everyone was so excited about them. That being said, I snapped a couple pics of some of the popular people just in case. I still don’t know who they are, so if you do, would you please tell me?

Like, who is that brunette? They were really excited about her

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId28.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId28.jpg)

And that girl with coffee. Who is she?

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId29.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId29.jpg)

Woman with funky suit and the two tall people with shaved heads were also popular.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId30.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId30.jpg)

Eventually someone told us that it was Paris fashion week, and it was designers and models exiting the building. Which explains why I don’t know who they are . . .

At one point, and very posh looking blonde couple emerged, and things got really crazy. You probably can’t see them in the middle, but here’s a picture of the hoard.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId31.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId31.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId32.jpg)

The best outfit that I saw emerge from the building, was easily this bright pink affair. I seemed to be the only one excited about it. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId33.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId33.jpg)

Eventually all the models got in these really nice SUVs with drivers and a security team (it totally looked like traveling with the Bravo’s real housewives), and then things calmed down. Our friends showed up, and we found out the Palais Garnier was closed the whole day due to the fashion shows. 

No worries, I had other plans for the neighborhood, which included a free tour of the Fragonard Museum of Perfume. We headed for the museum. 

I don’t even know why I took this picture, but it needed to be in the blog. My friend Melissa and her mom

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId34.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId34.jpg)

We wandered into a building labeled “Fragonard Museum” only to be told it was not the museum and redirected to a different building a few blocks away also labeled “Fragonard museum”.



The museum building was located in a really lovely square[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId35.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId36.jpg)

 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId39.jpg)

It was a cool museum that had a 1hr free tour that talked about the history of perfume, then ended with some sampling of Fragonard perfume. They also had a deal on perfume going for people on the tour, so it was a bit less than buying it at another Fragonard store.

A perfumer’s alchemy desk

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId41.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId41.jpg)

Historic perfume bottles. Fun fact, when plagues took hold in the medieval times, they stopped bathing because the water was dirty. And perfume was born. I can’t imagine that made things any better.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId43.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId43.jpg)

Then we looked at the beautiful labels and packaging of perfume. Melissa loves beautiful packaging.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId44.jpg)

The tour guide had us play a little game where we smelled wax with different scents on it, and were supposed to place the tubs on the correct smell. Jimmy and I were on a team joined by another man who, apparently, didn’t want to play with his family who was also on the tour.

Melissa’s team did really well. They got almost all of them correct.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId47.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId47.jpg)

Jimmy, me, and random dude didn’t get any right. Not even the ones that should have been easy like rose and orange blossom. Back to perfume school we go.

After that we got to sample some perfume, and then we all got suckered into something some. Which was the point of the free tour. It smells lovely, though, and Fragonards is only sold in Paris so it’s a fun souvenir.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId48.jpg)

After the tour, we hit the streets of Paris to visit the department store, Printemps, which has cool architecture and an awesome roof top terrace.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId49.jpg)



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId50.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId50.jpg)

Here’s the view from the top

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId52.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId56.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId56.jpg)

At about this point, we realized that we were all coming to depend on Jimmy to take pictures and navigate our way around. Melissa’s mom in particular became very attached Jimmy. At one point she told Melissa that she trusted Jimmy and would rather follow where he was going. Not gunna lie, Jimmy’s pretty cool, and has been a great sport traveling with all the ladies.

After visiting the terrace we grabbed lunch in one of the restaurants (they have one on each floor), and did some shopping. 

The view from the restaurant:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId57.jpg)

Jimmy found this:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId58.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId58.jpg)

So many eyes. 

After that, we hit up the metro

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId59.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId59.jpg)

And headed to the Rue Cler for some market fun. Spoiler alert: Rue Cler doesn’t have a market on Mondays, and today was Monday. Double spoiler: I made the same mistake on our last trip and should have known better.

The good news, was that it put us on the path for the Eiffel Tour just in time for sunset.

Here was our first glimpse, rising from the buildings like a giant . . . never mind what it looks like. It’s a tour.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId60.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId60.jpg)

Beautiful flowers on Rue Cler

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId61.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190121/imagerId61.jpg)

The beginning of sunset. We were waiting for Jimmy, Andrea, and Amy to buy water bottles at a grocery store. Yet again, we were held up by confusion around the automatic check out stand

And so we all posed with it

We walked around the tour, and headed across the river to wait for the light show to come on. As the sunset it got colder. Guys, it was soooooo cold.

We ended out the night with a great last dinner with our new and old friends, before we go our separate ways tomorrow.

Man, that was a long post. It took me a whole train ride and then some. Way to make it through to the end! 

Good night.
