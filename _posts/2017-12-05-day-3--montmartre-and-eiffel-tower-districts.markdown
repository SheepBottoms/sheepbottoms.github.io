ZZZZZZZZZZ. That’s me and Jimmy sleeping. Because we’re exhausted! Today was awesome, but oh so tiring. It started out slow enough. We got up and wondered to a bakery to grab almond croissants and coffee. It was very tasty, and we sat outside on a sidewalk table next to another young couple from Chicago (are we still considered “a young couple”? I’m just going to say yes.) We immediately recognized them as Americans because they were holding a Rick Steves book. 



Here’s some scenes from the morning:

We heard that some of the best views in Paris are from the dome of the Sacre Coeur basilica, so we hopped the metro to the Montmartre district. This is the district that is famous for it’s bohemian art scene.

They have a square full of street painters and sketch artists.

They also have a fun café scene.

As we walked from the square to the basilica, men kept approaching me with sketch books and asking if I would like my picture drawn. Jimmy is very sweet (and naïve) and commented that they must want to draw me because I’m so pretty. He stated, “They don’t look at me and ask. Only you.” I think they were asking me because I’m a woman, and they believed women were more vain than men. Because patriarchy. Either way, we made it the basilica.

Here’s the view from in front of the basilica:

The Eiffel tower is waaaaay in the distance. We’ll talk more about that later.





[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId22.jpg)



We climbed to the top of the dome, and this is what we saw.

Pretty amazing. Here’s some more views from the top.

This dude was maybe the coolest thing we saw.

By that point, we were ready to head out of Montmartre, and into the part of the town with the Eiffel tower. We had tickets to go up to the top just before dark. We went to the Rue Cler to grab lunch. It is a very cute street which is normally bustling with a market, but on Mondays the market is closed. The shops are open, so we wandered around and went into a restaurant for lunch.



 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId32.jpg)



Christmas trees for sale! We saw a couple getting ready to take one home on the metro.

After lunch we headed to the National Army Museum. Jimmy was hoping to see some Medieval weapons, and it where Napoleon is buried.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId35.jpg)



The army museum is in the square building, and Napoleon is in the dome. Here’s his tomb



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId36.jpg)



And the dome



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId37.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId37.jpg)



It was cool, but a bit anticlimactic. Unfortunately, the rest of the Army museum was closed. No idea why. It was lame.



After that, it was time to head to the Eiffel tower. There was a brief, slightly heated debate about whether we should take an Uber or walk. I was tired and just wanted to go sit in the park in front of the tower, but Jimmy was all about the walk. He won. The walk took longer than he had promised me, and I started to get grumpy. We neared a corner and I said that we had better turn that corner and be dazzled by an in-your-face view of the ET (not the movie one, the tower one). We turned the corner and BOOM! Jimmy delivered.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId38.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId38.jpg)



We proceeded to take about a million pictures of the tower: Me with the tower, Jimmy with the tower, me and Jimmy with the tower, the tower alone. I tried to pair it down for the blog.

The park leading up to the ET was really fun, because people brought their dogs and they were all playing in the grass. It was pretty cute, and made me miss Byron.



Then we went up to the top. You can go to the first floor, second floor, and ninth floor. The elevators have huge windows, so you can watch as you shoot into the sky. It really messed with Jimmy’s comfort level of heights, but the top was beautiful.

Fun story, when we were waiting to get into the elevator and head to the top floor, we ran into our Canadian friends from the line at Versailles the day before. Small world.



We head back down the tower just in time to catch the light show.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId52.jpg)



Which is really hard to catch in a picture. Here’s the best one.

We had some time to kill before a dinner cruise along the Seine river that we had booked, so we ran back to Rue Cler for some cocoa and to see the Christmas lights on the street.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId54.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId54.jpg)



Not gunna lie, London’s Christmas light game is way stronger than Paris’. Maybe its too early in the season.



Last but not least, the dinner cruise. We looked awesome, the food was great, our waiter was cool, and the views were amazing.

Jimmy had foie gras as an appetizer. I tried it and thought it was pretty gross, but he said he liked it. (Note from Jimmy: It tasted like soft cheese with a ducky aftertaste...)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171204/imagerId57.jpg)



After four courses of food, a bottle of wine, a few glasses of champagne, and some lovely views we stumbled home around 11:30 and crawled into bed.



So Brianna, that’s the long story about why the blog is late. Love you!



Good night!
