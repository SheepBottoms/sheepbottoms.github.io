Ahhh. I have made it to my first blog post. I almost just crawled into bed an fell asleep, but decided to set a good precedent and write.

Today was awesome and tiring, mainly because it was actually two days. We woke up at 4pm on Friday morning, mainly because Jimmy was terrified that the government shutdown would cause TSA at SeaTac to be awful. TSA at SeaTac is always awful, but we’re prechecked now, which meant security took 15 minutes, then we sat around the terminal for two hours. We flew 5 hours to JFK, then another 7 to Paris. We arrived in Paris before the sun did on Saturday morning.

Us on the plane[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId4.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId4.jpg)

I don’t think either of slept great on the plan, and our landing in Paris at 6:30am meant we had a whole day to hold it together before sleeping. Rule of thumb for time changing: naps are the devil and will ruin your sleep.

We started out waiting for the tourist office at the airport to open up so we could buy our Paris Museum Pass, and I headed in to the bathroom to make myself semi-presentable. 

After we got our passes, we headed into Paris to find some breakfast and chill until our Airbnb became available at 12pm. Here’s some attempted sunrise views from the train into Paris. [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId5.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId5.jpg)

The great news about that is that Gare de Lyon, which is near where we are staying, has great left luggage storage. The bad news is that there are no signs for it and it’s really hard to find. Fast forward through an hour of attempting to locate lost luggage, and we had hit the streets of the area between the Bastille and Marais districts of Paris, and were on a our way to a café.

Guys, these neighborhoods are so cute. Here’s a street walking towards the Bastille

And here is the Bastille, the monument celebrating the French Revolution. Fun fact, the Bastille used to be a prison, until the revolutionaries tore it down.

More wandering until we found just the right café

So many cute places, but we eventually ended up at cute little Café des Agnes. Jimmy has been desperately wanting to learn French, so I let him take the lead, and the waitress was great about working through the French with him and moving into English for me. I got to have my first French hot chocolate this trip. It is so amazing!

After breakfast we wandered the Marais district, looking for my favorite local Paris designer’s atelier for the trip we took last year. Jimmy didn’t see it last year, so I wanted to show him . . . and maybe get a couple new pieces. 

More wandering

We eventually found the shop and they were so sweet. I got a couple of new things, then we high tailed it our Airbnb to check in. The host was really nice. His English was awesome, but he gave Jimmy directions in French to help him practice. Here’s a view of the room.

After checking in, we went back out and headed to the Picasso museum. 

Making our way to the museum:

Before hitting the museum we grabbed lunch at a brassiere called Robert and Louise. They cooked they meat over an open fire, and welcomed us in at the bar even though the were full. Very tasty.

It did have a lovely view

It’s in a beautiful mansion in the Marais district, and is amazing if you love Picasso. A lot of it are his personal works that he created and displayed in his home. We think Picasso is good, but I think we’ve been to one too many Picasso museums. We were also starting to get very tired, and my friend Melissa was supposed to show up with her mom any minute. We headed back to the Airbnb to “rest”, which really meant we accidentally fell asleep. 

We awoke to text messages that my friend was waiting for luggage to arrive, and wouldn’t be able to meet us that day. We decided it was dinner time, and headed out to find our favorite falafel street from our last trip. On they way we found this:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId47.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId47.jpg)

And we got some dessert. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId48.jpg)

We also stopped by a grocery store to pick some bananas for the morning, and found this wonderful contraption. It’s a juicer you can use to make fresh orange juice right in the grocery store. Magic.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId49.jpg)

After falafel, we did some night time wandering.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId56.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId56.jpg)

And ended up at late hours at the Pompidou Center, which is a museum of modern art

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId57.jpg)

Oved it.[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId58.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190119/imagerId58.jpg)

I would love to take you on a visual journey of the museum, but it would ruin the surprise for when you go. Just know that once you go in, there’s no going out, and it will literally drive you insane. Or maybe that’s me. I think Jimmy loved it.

Now we’re back in our comfy Airbnb and ready for sleep. SO READY FOR SLEEP.

Goodnight.
