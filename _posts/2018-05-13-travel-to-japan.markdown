Well, hello hello! I writing to you all straight from my Air Bnb in Tokyo. Overall, the journey here was pretty good. It was our first time flying Air Canada, and their food is terrible, but everything else was fine. Jimmy’s dad, Jim, was very excited that we were going to have our first experience on a Boeing 787 dream liner, and it was . . . a plane. Honestly, the only different I noticed was that you tint the window to different levels of brightness and create mood lighting . . . for sleep.

Here’s some pics of landing in Tokyo:

We landed in Tokyo and were shuffled through the Narita airport towards customs. It was a great introduction to Tokyo, because it was both extremely efficient, and extremely confusing. It was also extremely crowded. We made it through, and now we both have a stamp from Japan on our passports. 

Getting from the airport to our BnB was a breeze, and the views from the train were pretty as we went around the city rather than through it,

 When we excited our train station we accidently wandered into a bunch of people in tradition outfits singing, dancing, and carrying a shrine. It was slightly inconvenient with our suitcases, but super fun to join along. Our BnB is in an awesome neighborhood, which I’ll talk more about when we leave. Just in case there are creepers.

Customs took so long that by the time we got through and found out place, it was time for dinner. Here’s our wandering journey:

The area around Ueno station is obsessed with pandas, because the Tokyo zoo is in Ueno park and they have a family of pandas there including a baby. More on that later.

Lonely Planet had given me a heads up about a traditional Japanese Izakaya (Japanese version of a pub) called Shinsuke which had friendly staff and menus in English. We thought it would be a good opportunity to get our feet wet, so we headed out. It was very cute in an old wooden building. We were seated in the back in a corner, and a couple of young Japanese men were sitting at a table next to us. They immediately noticed we were English speakers, and started up a conversation right away. One of them said, “I am an English teacher here for high school, so it’s good for me to practice with English speakers.” He and his friend helped us decided on some small dishes to order, and went through how to drink sake and say cheers in Japan. His main advice was “Sake alcohol is strong, so you have to share it and sip it.” She had some great Sashimi, tempura, mixed veggies, and some cherry blossom ice cream that was life changing.

Ouch, now we all know I can’t actually use chop sticks . . . you’re not supposed to cross them at the top like that.

While at the izakaya, a group of men in tradition Japanese outfits came in and started drumming and singing. Our friends got really excited, and everyone in the izakaya stopped what they were doing to listen. He handed out pamphlets to everyone and left. Our friends explained it was sumo wrestlers who go to special local places and sing to advertise and get good luck before matches. Our server said it was very special because they only choose a few places and only come once a year. Our new friends were very excited and told us they had never seen it before, but had always heard about it.

 After that, it was time to head to bed as neither of us could keep our eyes open. It was time to head back home.

 We dropped into a little bakery that had panda shaped pastries, grabbed a snack for tonight and breakfast tomorrow, and went to sleep.
