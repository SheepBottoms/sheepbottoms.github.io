If you don’t want to see tons of pictures of cute little snow monkeys in the mountains, then don’t bother reading this post. Seriously. That’s all that’s in here.

This morning we woke up in our Ryokan, donned our yukatas, and headed to the breakfast room to enjoy a Japanese breakfast. The breakfast room was right around the corner from our sleeping room, and as Jimmy and I rounded the corner we saw that no one else was in their yukatas in the breakfast room. Without saying a word to each other we both turned around, went back to our room, and changed into our western clothes. Goodbye beautifully comfortable yukata.

Breakfast

After breakfast, our ryokan took us up to the mountains on a shuttle bus. They dropped our luggage at a café near the train station, and pointed at the bus stop we were supposed to get to that would take us from the mountain to the train station. Yep, they shuttled us up there, and then let us know we needed to find our way back. Which felt strange.

When we were dropped off, we were told it would take about a 15min walk to get to the monkey park. Which was weird, because all the signs said 30 minutes. We decided to take it as a sign that we looked fit and could do the walk in half the time.

The views from the walk up.

There was a gift shop and café halfway up the walk. Jimmy noted that they had lifted the font from Star Wars to advertise “fried chicken”

These signs were about every 10 feet on the walk up. Those monkeys mean business.

When we first got to the park, we were told that the monkeys were “somewhere high in the mountains” and they were “looking for them so we can bring them down.” Which left me wondering what they do to “bring down” the monkeys. I was picturing them running behind the monkeys shooing them onward like chickens, but instead they use a very modern system of blowing a monkey whistle and feeding them as soon as they show up. 

Here’s where we were waiting for the monkeys

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId21.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId21.jpg)

When the guy was blowing the monkey whistle, we (Me, Jimmy, and about 10 other tourists) were standing there staring at a hill side full of shrubbery. I was teasing Jimmy that the monkeys were going to come stampeding down the hillside like the antelope stampede in The Lion King. Instead, one monkey cautiously made his way down. The guy blowing the whistle gave him an apple, then we saw a couple more slowly make their way down.

Here’s the dude with the apple and his buddy

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId22.jpg)

Guys, I’m not even kidding, after that things started to happen really fast. All of a sudden monkeys were pouring down hillside in total antelope stampeding fashion, and they start crossing the stream, climbing the bridge, and head right for us. The man with the whistle spread food out for them (it looked like some kind of grain) and they all excitedly started eating, paying no attention to any of us.

Jimmy and I were standing on the stairs watching these monkeys

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId24.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId24.jpg)

They got closer

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId25.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId25.jpg)

And closer

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId26.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId26.jpg)

And ended up coming right past us as we hurriedly ran up the stairs. There were signs everywhere telling us to not get too close to the monkeys, but nobody was telling the monkeys not to get too close to us.

So we think this guy must be the big kahuna of all the monkeys at the monkey hot tub. He was the first one down, and the only got who got a whole apple all to himself. He also took care of business when the other monkeys started fighting.

If you can’t tell from the pic, I was a little freaked out. They were SO CLOSE. And these are not nice, tame monkeys.

Monkey checking out a tourist’s clear umbrella because it looks like a plastic bag which you’re not allowed to bring to the monkey park because monkeys associate clear plastic bags with food.

Okay, I have about 1,000 other monkey pictures I could put on here, but we’ll call that good for now. After leaving the monkey park we wandered down the mountain, and with every step we took Jimmy was getting sicker. Poor Jimmy came down with his usual traveling cold, and it seemed to hit hard as soon as we left the monkey park. By the time we got down the hill, he was looking truly miserable. The town, however, was super cute.

 On the upside, I found one of my new favorite things: Apple Kit Kats. They are seriously amazing. Apparently Japan is one of the biggest consumers of Kit Kats in the World, has their own Kit Kat factory, and has nearly 100 flavors of Kit Kats that are unique to Japan, apple being one of them. 

Ptions wi[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId65.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/18/imagerId65.jpg)

They are lovely. We found them at a gift shop about halfway down the hill from the monkey park. This was just a few minutes before we got to the bottom of the hill and realized the bus to the train station only runs once an hour, and we missed it by 10 minutes. A small crisis ensued as poor sick and hungry Jimmy struggled to brainstorm options with me for getting lunch and to the train station, both had which had suddenly become crucial. I’m not great in a crisis anyway, but I had taken a picture of the local cab company, so we gave them a call to come get us. Jimmy asked the gentleman who answered the phone if he spoke English, he said, “no”, and Jimmy hung up the phone, desperation taking over again. After a few minutes of aimless wandering looking for a restaurant open in the small winter get away town we were in, Jimmy decided to use google translate for another attempt at communication with the cab company. He was successful, and within 10 minutes we were headed to the train station and the day was saved. We also drove by this store, which I thought was kind of hilarious.

In case you can’t see, it’s called American Drug. 

There was also a ramen place next door to the train station that did sweetened matcha shakes and made mixed the recipes of ramen and soba noodles together making something unique and lovely.

After lunch we hopped our train back to Nagano. Here’s some reminders of the beautiful countryside.

From Nagano we caught a 3 hour train south to Kyoto, which I am so excited to explore because I keep hearing it described as the cultural center of Japan. 

Here’s some pics from that train ride:

Honestly, the train ride was spectacular, but Jimmy was really sick and slept the whole time, and I was trying to catch up on blog writing so we didn’t get many pictures. If you want to see it, you’ll just have to go (and I definitely recommend it).

We made it to Kyoto, which was very hot and humid compared to the cool air in the mountains. We got off at Kyoto station, and tracked the 15 minutes with our luggage to our AirBnB. On the corner of the train station we saw a golden oasis looming like a temptress in the sun: McDonald’s. We have made it the whole trip so far without giving into the temptation of the golden arches, but with Jimmy sick, the weather so hot, and me a bit tired of fish and noodles, McDonalds had suddenly become a real contender for dinner. We looked at recommendations our AirBnB host had left for us, and decided to set out for a coke and hamburger. 

Two doors down from the McDonalds, we noticed one of the restaurants recommended by the AirBnB as a great place for Soba and tempura. We decided that deep fried shrimp was close enough to American food, and wandered in. We were given our tempura, and waited patiently for our soba. I noticed the woman next to Jimmy kept looking over at us, but thought we probably just looked hot, tired, and terrible, and decided to ignore it. Eventually she said in a lovely Scottish accent “Well, you can’t just sit there with the tempura and wait for the noodles. You have to eat the tempura while it’s hot.” She went on to describe that she had been having such a hard time watching our tempura get cold. She told us about her previous experiences in Japan, and gave some recommendations on things to do in Kyoto. I also tried plum wine at the restaurant, which was a little bit pruney, but overall pretty good. With that, we headed home and crawled into bed. At 8:30pm.

The restaurant and food:

Ah, before we got into bed I noticed that my foot was hurting and had swelled up. I think I must have gotten stung by something at the monkey park. The swelling has stayed at my foot, so I’m going to head to bed and hope it’s better in the morning.

Good night.
