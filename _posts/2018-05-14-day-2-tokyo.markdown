Good morning! Or night. I’m having a hard time keeping track of days and nights back home. Good news, Jimmy and I slept great last night. We woke up at 6am, ready to hit the hot streets of Tokyo. We ate our yummy yummy panda pastries (they were filled with custard, chocolate custard, or red bean paste in case you were curious), and bananas in a bag. I don’t know why, but the individually wrapped bananas were super cute to me.

Nibbling on my chocolate custard bear. Jimmy refused a pic of him nibbling on his custard turtle. It was early, so I didn’t push it. As we were getting ready, we heard shouting in the street below our balcony. Not angry shouting, happy shouting. Of A LOT of people. The shrine carriers were back, complete with a dude on horseback. We heard from someone that the celebrations were to kick off the beginning of the national sumo tournament which begins today. We get to go watch tomorrow.

We got ready for the day, and hit the streets to visit Ueno park and find coffee. 

Just a man, alone, hitting the urban jungle

Beautiful building on the outskirts of the park

I don’t want any judgement from anyone, but the coffee was found was a giant Starbucks in the park.In our defense, everyone else was there too. Also in our defense, they sell waffles at Starbucks in Japan.

And also, how genius is this? It’s like a bike rack for dogs.

We ate outside in beautiful 70 degree weather, watching hoards of children show up to the zoo. The zoo wasn’t set to open for an hour, and there were already a ton of people in line, so we decided to visit the peony garden.

Now, if you’ve really been paying attention, you may notice none of the pics so far actually have peonies in them. That’s because getting into the peony garden had a pretty high fee. I was into it, but my partner in crime was not, so this is the closest I got.

Instead we visited a peaceful and beautiful shrine.

These are wooden signs that you could buy and put dreams, ideas, or resolutions on. If you leave it behind, it’s good luck.

This is a station where you can pour water of your hands to wash them before visiting the shrine. I went ahead and tried it out.

Even though the park is very green, you can still tell that it is the middle of high tech Tokyo because there was totally a selfie stand. Which is how we got this:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId33.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId33.jpg)



The shrine was very ornate, with lots of carvings and decorations.

This is the best view of the pagoda that we got.

Fish banners . . . I just thought they were kind of fun.

Top attractions in the park were things at the top of Jimmy’s to do list in Japan: see pandas and visit the Tokyo museum. The line for the zoo still looked like a nightmare, so we headed to the museum first, where there was not line. We decided to get audio guides because like to learn about the art, and the guides had a lot of great info, but they had signs in in English everywhere so we probably could have skipped them.

Here’s the view of the museum.

While we were in the museum, a street party had erupted in the park. It was about lunch time, so we decided to hit it up and see what kind of food we could find.

Jimmy asks me what I’m looking for. I answer “meat on a stick. You can never go wrong with meat on a stick.” Or can you?

The one in my left hand was seasoned beef which was amazing. The one in my right hand was salted river fish, which was . . . salty. I watched the guys next me eat the whole thing. Bones and all. I was impressed, but didn’t make it quite as far.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId68.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId68.jpg)

I did better with some dumplings in a sweet soy sauce, and Jimmy got a great noodle dish.

I also got the most AMAZING shaved ice. I thought Hawaiian shaved ice was where it was at, but Japanese shaved ice is on a whole new level. People, they use real fruit syrup made from a fruit reduction that morning. It was the most wonderful food of my life so far. I ate it so fast I didn’t even get a picture. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId71.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId71.jpg)

It turned out that the street party was a Japanese cultural celebration. They had fan and sword dancers perform, which was so fun to see.

After lunch the crowds had finally died down at the zoo, so we decided to go visit a panda. You had to have special tickets to see the baby and mom panda (which explained the long lines) and they were all sold out when we got there. We visited daddy panda, who slept the whole time.

Panda bottom!

We all got very excited when he started to sit up, but this was as far as he got.

After the zoo we headed back to our home base for a brief siesta, then hit the streets of Asakusa to find the Senso-Ji shrine, which is the most visited shrine in Tokyo. Asakusa is one of the oldest parts of Tokyo, and is filled with cute streets, shops, street food, and tons of people. On our way to the shrine it started to rain a bit, so Jimmy picked up an umbrella.

Jimmy pre-umbrella

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId84.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId84.jpg)

I brought the umbrella I bought in London a couple years ago. It’s travel sized, wind proofed, and the BOMB! I recommended Jimmy bring his own umbrella because it’s also small, and he shot me down. Bummer.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId90.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId90.jpg)

You’re supposed to enter the Shrine via large ornate gates at the end of a busy pedestrian street with lots of stalls where people sell things. We snuck in via the side.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId91.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/14/imagerId91.jpg)

Umbrellas in Tokyo are actually a lot of fun. Most people have beautifully colored umbrellas, and often they have cute designs. Very different than the all black ones in London. Jimmy, of course, found the only black one at the shop.

This is the beautiful front gate we were supposed to enter. Also, my leather flats used to be light brown . . .

After tea it was back to the rain to wander Harajuku shopping street heading towards Shibuya.

Welcome to Shibuya crossing. It is the bussiest intersection in the world.

By this point were ridiculously wet, very hungry, and getting tired. We headed into a Izakaya that specialized in different types of grilled meat in different area of the bar. We sat in the pork section and had wonderful pork katsu and stir fry.
