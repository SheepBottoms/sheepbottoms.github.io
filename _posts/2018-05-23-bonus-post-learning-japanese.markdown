They say when you want to learn a new language you should keep a blog to help track progress and help build motivated. Since I am *WAY* too lazy to do that (this is Jimmy btw) I decided to write this **BONUS** post on how I'm learning this language. No, there will not be excessive pictures or anything even all that interesting here but *just in case* someone is interested in learning Japanese, here is what I have found that might be helpful.

**Why Japanese?**

I wanted to learn a few phrases before our trip. When I have studied languages in the past (this will be my third language to attempt to learn) I have found an abundance of great learning tools that help me get started. I can quickly learn a few phrases, build some good habits and maintain momentum for about 6 months when whatever tool I was using ends. Nobody is fluent from Duolingo, maybe you can read a bit by the end but really you just want to throw up if you have to repeat the “basic phrases” exercise one more time or look at any more ads. There is always a huge gap, the intermittent gap, where there is barley anything the help you learn your new language. My bilingual coworkers describe a point where they no longer needed to translate in their heads. It’s a tipping point where suddenly movies, books, news and all kinds of media become available. Having conversations, though awkward, become possible and productive. I’ve never reached this point but, **life goal**, I really want to find it at least once…

So why Japanese? I am blown away by the resources I’ve found! Not only are they excellent and engaging compared to any of the other crap I’ve tried, they are long term. 1-2 years of material. *Assuming I stick with it* I believe that with the plan below I will be able to read quite a bit in one year and read just about anything in two. I will be able to speak and have conversations with a vocab of about 3000+ words (85% of the language) and hopefully, hopefully, hopefully, bridge the intermittent gap.

**Current Status**

To be clear, I am a beginner. I officially started studying on April 1st so its been about 2 months as of this writing. I can:
* Seamlessly read hiragana, katakana (Japanese has three alphabets, four if you count the English alphabet). (Also, when I say read, I can properly-ish pronounce what I’m reading but will have no idea what it means.)
* I can recognize 130 Kanji (Kanji is the third alphabet containing about 2000 characters)
* have a current vocab of just over 300 words.
(How do I know all this? Because WaniKani tracks if for me which is awesome!)

On one hand, this is super pitifully and I have an insane about of work ahead of me. But, as I understand it, this is about as much as a full year of traditional classroom study! I really have no idea if I will become fluent and *I make no promises* but after two months I still feel excited and feel that I am making good progress, could happen?

Quick side note, if my new friends from Japan are reading this, I really want to practice Japanese! Keep bugging me to study and embarrass myself!

**The Plan**

Japanese is made up of 4 alphabets and we start by learning these. The first is just English characters used mostly for typing on an English computer. Congrats, you already know this one. The second is Hiragana, 46 characters, easier than the English alphabet and less sounds. Takes a few days to learn with the mnemonics on Tofugu. The third is Katakana which is the same sounds but different characters. Used for words that are not Japanese (like banana バナナ, or pasta パスタ for example) that have been brought in to the language but read similar to the actual English word. The forth alphabet is famously hard, kanji. It’s the Chinese characters that were imported over hundreds of years. There are 2000 some characters to learn and they each have multiple pronunciations for different uses. Without WaniKani, I'm pretty sure this would be $*&#^ing impossible. But with WaniKani, you can expect to learn this in about 1.5 years which is enough to read news/books/whatever.

General strategy:

Start by learning the two new alphabets and getting started with WaniKani. Then we will mix in some grammar and work on speaking.

Instructions:

1. Tae Kim does a good overview/background of the different alphabets here: http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/writing
2. Learn Hiragana roughly, don't have to be perfect but have covered everything roughly. https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/
3. Start WaniKana, it starts very slow then picks up after 1 week
4. Start reading “Japanese for the Western Brain”. It’s not super long and will give you more context on what to expect. https://kimallen.sheepdogdesign.net/
5. Start learning Katakana: https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/
6. Start CleverDeck. This teaches the inverse of what we cover in WaniKani, given an English word, say it in Japanese. Mix in some spaced repetition magic and you’re on your way to speaking.
7. When you reach level 10 or so in WaniKani, begin working through Tae Kim.

Goals:
1. Learn to read at an intermediate/advanced level in 1 year. Start reading regularly in Japanese (news/books/whatever).
2. Lay the foundation for speaking/listening. My plan is after 6 months to a year to start skype language lessons and focus more on the speaking/listening once I have a bit of a foundation.

Tools:

**Tae Kim Japanese complete guide:**

http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/

Cost: Free! (there are ads for the book but it says in the description that it’s the same content, only for those that want a physical book)

Time: each video/concept is about 2-3min long, and about 85ish total

Includes both a video series and a written part for each concept.

**Japanese for the Western Brain:**

https://kimallen.sheepdogdesign.net/

Cost: Free!

Time: About 15 blog posts so not long. Helpful to understand the reason behind some of the weird stuff you will see in WaniKani.

**Learn Hiragana:**

https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/

Cost: Free!

Time: a few days

Tools: https://realkana.com/ (free)

For fun (but not necessarily needed) to learn how to draw the characters use the app: "Japanese!" ($7.99)

**Learn Katakana:**

https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/

Cost: Free!

Time: a few days

Tools: https://realkana.com/ (free)

For fun (but not necessarily needed) to learn how to draw the characters use the app: "Japanese!" ($7.99)

**Learn Kanji:**

https://www.wanikani.com/

Cost: $10 per month but don't have to pay until level three which is at least a month out.

Time: periodic reviews throughout the day, maybe 30 min a day? Similar to a phone game or Facebook where I log into when I’m bored/need a distraction. To learn the full course is about 1.5 years. The company is Portland based and awesome. They sent me stickers!

Includes Kanji vocab words and pronunciations

**CleverDeck (phone app):**

Cost: $2.99 per month

I’ve tried a bunch of the spaced repetition apps but this one is the best by far. Uses a native speaker and really helps with speaking rather then the reading focus that you get from WaniKani.

**Memrise (optional phone app):**

Cost: $30? Not clear if this is optional to skip sections you don't want

Covers sentences and grammar, includes vocab that you don't get in wanikani (words that are all hiragana). Includes useful phrases. I think its worth thinking about but I have been a bit overloaded with the other tools.

Duolingo is dumb and they keep finding new ways to beg for money. Not a fan at all…
