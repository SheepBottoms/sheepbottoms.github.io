Awww, today was amazing. Just like there are days where everything goes wrong (hello yesterday), there are days where everything goes right. Where everything falls right into place and works out perfectly to create the perfect day. That was today.
I’d been nervous about this day since we realized we’d be traveling to Ireland in December (seriously, who does that?). I REALLY wanted to drive the causeway coast, but in order to make it not miserable, a million key factors needed to fall into place. The biggest and most unpredictable was the weather.
Jimmy tells me that we haven’t really given Belfast a fair shake, because we spent so little time there. He may be right, but one thing I know for sure is that I have a definite negative association with that city. When we woke up this morning and got ready to get the rental car, it was pouring down hail. Pouring. It looked like it was about to be the most miserable day ever. 
We decided to give it a try, though, and went ahead and picked up the car. First things first, Jimmy is a UK driving BOSS! He was nervous about the whole different side of the road thing, but he developed the mantra “stay to the left” and it served him well.

Beautiful ocean views and sheep. Who could ask for more? We felt like it was the most beautiful place ever, and nothing could top it . . . until we got to Giant’s Causeway. 
Giant’s Causeway is a set of interesting rock formations located along the most beautiful coastline on earth. There is an audio guide that explains the geology and mythology surrounding the Giant’s Causeway, but it’s super hokey and we gave up on it pretty quickly. The important thing is to hike around the coastline.

If you go, definitely take the red trail. Yes, you do have to climb 196 slippery stone steps and scramble along the side of a cliff with no guard rail, but the views are worth it.

After hiking the Causeway, we found that we still had no rain and a bit of light, so we decided to head to Dunluce Castle just up the road and snap a couple of pictures. Dunluce Castle is in ruins, but it continues to look amazing sitting right on the cliff face.

After grabbing a quick picture of the castle, we headed to the Bushmills Old Distillery, to see if we could still get tickets on one of their tours. We walked right in and got on the last one of the day. The tour itself was just ok, and you only got one free sample at the end, but the temperatures were dropping and it was starting to rain, so being inside was perfect.
After the tour we continued to head up the Causeway coast, to our base for the night in Londonderry/Derry. We wondered town and went to a Rick Steve’s recommended place, to find that it was much fancier than we expected. We were in jeans and shirts, others were in suits and ballgowns. They went ahead and served us an amazing meal.

And so ends, the perfect day on the Causeway Coast.
