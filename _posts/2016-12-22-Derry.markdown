Today we got to spend an amazing day in a city that has one of the most tumultuous histories I’ve ever heard. You may notice at the top that the city actually has two names, the original Irish name “Derry” and the name the British gave it when they conquered it “Londonderry”. I’m going to call it Derry, because that’s what most people we talked to called it and it’s shorter.

We had kind of rocky start to the day. We’re staying at a very cute bed and breakfast, but the owners do not live on site. Attached the BnB is a tea room that serves tea, lunch, and breakfast, and it’s also adorable. At midnight, we noticed things were getting pretty loud in the tea room. There was a lot of laughing and yelling. We had done so much hiking the day before, and were desperately trying to sleep to recuperate. I was not in the mood. They quieted down after about half an hour, only to return a little after two thirty AM. 
We had been in our room the whole time and had not seen these people, but it sounded like they shouting chants. They were chanting over and over again. When they didn’t quiet down after half an hour, I couldn’t take it anymore. I was convinced that they were probably Satanists, and the BnB was about to turn into The Exorcist. Because that is the most rational idea my brain can come up with at 3am. I got up and opened our door. I could hear the chanting downstairs, but all of a sudden it stopped, and I heard

	“I’m friends with the monster that’s under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head.
	You trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I’m crazy. But that’s ok.”

Yep, they weren’t chanting. They were just a bunch of tone deaf people singing along to pop lyrics. Deciding that I was not about to enter a lair of demon possession, I went downstairs and peeked around a corner. There were four people sitting at a table who looked they could not have been older than 18. I pop around the corner with my hair all on end and in my Pj’s, looking like the ghost of Christmas yet to come. Yes, children, welcome to the future when you don’t get an adequate amount of sleep. 

I asked them nicely to quiet down, and they were very sweet and respectful and went to bed immediately. I imagine seeing someone who is so old they are no longer fresh at 3am really put their lives in perspective.
After finally getting some good sleep, Jimmy and I headed down to the tea room for our free full Irish breakfast. We were so late that we were worried we had missed breakfast, but the owner and cook was so lovely and nothing but welcoming. The tea room is open to the public, so we got to eat with some local construction workers who are regulars at her shop.

How amazing is that.
Today was our first really rainy day, but we came prepared with rain gear so we hit the streets of Derry anyway. The city was originally a fortressed city, and you still walk along the walls of the old fortress.

I decided that it was raining so hard, that I was in need of an umbrella. Luckily, there was a place called “Poundland” which is the UK equivalent of the dollar store. And they sold umbrellas. For a pound. With my umbrella in tow, we head on top of the walls.

Jimmy really liked the cannon. I thought it odd that the cannon was pointing right at the Guildhall.

See, look great that Poundland umbrella looks. I’m a genius!
Less than 5 minutes after taking that picture the umbrella whipped inside out and broke. RIP Poundland umbrella. It was a great 10 minutes.
Due to the ridiculous amount of rain and the breaking of my umbrella, we ducked into a coffee shop and bakery for a snack.

Mmmmmm.

A cool thing about the bakery, It was named after my ancestors!

In general, that was kind of a cool thing about being in Derry. My maternal grandmother’s maiden name was Daugherty, which is an Americanized version of O’Doherty, which was a major Irish clan in Co. Antrim, particularly in Derry. I told one woman I talked to that I was a descendant of the O’Doherty clan and she stated, “Oh well welcome home because just about everyone is an O’Doherty around here.” 
We went into a museum in the city walls called the Tower Museum, which is housed in a tower that was originally built and owned by the O’Doherty clan.

This museum was all about the history of Derry, and is definitely worth a look. The Irish and English fought over the city for hundreds of years, and the museum tells the story of what they call “The struggle for peace.”

Fun fact I learned about my family in the museum: In the 1600’s our clan leader led a rebellion against the English who were controlling the city at the time, and burned it to the ground. 

Another fun fact not about my family: There were mannequins in this museum as well. Seriously, everywhere we go they have creepy mannequins acting out various strange things. At one point in the museum they have a video about the O’Doherty rebellion. They talk about the English regaining control, and putting people’s head on spikes outside the city walls. A light flashes on revealing a gory mannequin head on a spike. Why? I can’t make this stuff up.

No photography allowed in this museum, though, so I can’t share any of the creepiness.

When the rain let up for a while we were able to walk the complete circumference of the city walls. Here are some lovely views of inside the walls.

And here’s some fun we had while walking the walls.

Yep, those are torn out pages of Rick Steves guide book I’m holding. He’s corny as all get out, but that man knows how to travel.

Man, you have to watch Jimmy every moment or he gets into trouble.

After walking the walls, we walked around inside the walls, and met some nice people.

The rain started coming down even worse, so we headed back to the BnB for some good ole’ fashioned napping. After napping came dinner, and enjoying the light in the old city.

We were wondering by the Guildhall, and noticed that the doors were still open. We wandered inside to see if it was still open to the public, and a woman excitedly motioned us in. She stated, “Oh, we’re doing a grand choir concert and if you go upstairs we’ll get you some food and tea too. I was astonished and said, “And it’s open to the public?” She nodded and stated, “Yeah, all are welcome.” Which was completely contradictory to the sign at the bottom of the stairs that stated, “Not open to the public.” 
We wandered upstairs anyway, and were ushered into a room with a large, ornate organ.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161222/image30.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161222/image30.jpeg)

Some ladies sat next to us, and I asked what exactly we were attending. One of the ladies said, “Well I don’t really know. My friend knows one of the women in the choir so we came on down.” Which made us feel better because nobody knew what we were all doing there. We had a wonderful conversation with the ladies, one of whom grew up in Derry and was able to talk about what the city was like when it was segregated into Catholic and Protestant sectarian neighborhoods. It was clear she was surprised to hear we were staying in the Bogside neighborhood, as it was a former Catholic neighborhood with a bad reputation (Don’t worry family, it’s been totally rejuvenated and was totally safe). 
In the end, we found out that we had been ushered into the Mayor’s Christmas Coral Concert, which had been poorly advertised so lacked attendance. Which was why they were dragging people off the streets. Our gain.

Good night.
