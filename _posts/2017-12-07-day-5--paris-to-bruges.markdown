Just a heads up for everyone: not many pictures today because it was mainly a travel day. 



We had to check out of our Airnbnb in the morning, which meant some ridiculous traipsing around with our luggage to haul it the train station to lock up, the heading back to hit the streets of Paris one last time. 



Our AirBnb was pretty funny. It was a loft apartment up 5 flights of rickety wooden stairs, and consisted of a room that was maybe 80 square feet with the shower included. The shower was so small that I barely fit. I have no idea Jimmy managed it. The room was so small that the heating was great, but for some reason coming out of the tiny shower was freezing regardless of the temperature of the rest of the room. It was the weirdest phenomenon, and easily the worst part of everyday. Other than that, the place was great. The fold out bed was surprisingly comfortable, it was in a wonderful neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants, and still managed to be quiet. The best part was that it saved it us a ton of money so we were able to eat and shop well in Paris. 



We spent the morning and early afternoon, getting in our last minute wishes in Paris. Jimmy wanted to visit another museum, and I wanted to shop, so we split up.



Jimmy visited the Orsay museum, and said he loved it. I can’t say much about it because I wasn’t there, but Jimmy seemed to have a good time. Here are some of his pics.

He also went back to the Louvre, which he stated was his favorite part of Paris.

I went on my first ever Airbnb excursion, which was shopping with a stylist. Aneta is a fashion stylist who works styling models for magazines in Paris. Through her work, she got to meet a lot of independent French fashion designers, and learned a lot about what she called “quality fashion verses fashion hype.” She took me on a tour of the independent designers in the Marais district, focusing on designers that make their clothing in France using French materials. She also took to me a couple of vintage shops in the area. It was really fun to walk around with her and learn about the different types of French fashion. She took me to some pretty fashion forward places at first, but I think quickly learned that my style is more classic, so we ended up in the shop of a designer named Koshka Mashka who studied fashion in Italy but is currently located in Paris. She has a small boutique upstairs, with a workshop downstairs in lovely space with exposed stone walls. She and her team make all of her pieces in Paris using fabrics made only in France. Her things were lovely and classic, and it was fun to meet her and hear about how she creates her work. I was also able to pick up a couple of pieces to bring home.



After that Jimmy and I met up at the train station, and caught our train to Belgium. Before I move on to Belgium, I want to leave a quick word about Paris. As we were planning our trip, we got a lot of mixed responses from others about their views on France in Paris. Some of the views were from people who have never been there, and some of them were from people who had. Some people loved Paris, and some hated it.



The most common reasons for disliking Paris seemed to center on the attitude of Parisians, and the level of cleanliness of the city. Just to be upfront, Jimmy and I loved Paris. We found the people to be distant but courteous, and thought the areas of the city we visited were lovely. We didn’t have any bad experiences with waiters, people in shops, or people in the streets. We actually found most people to be friendly once engaged, but not likely to make the first move. We also didn’t notice smells in the subway as other people had complained to me. Jimmy and I were talking about these differing experiences that people have to Paris and Parisians, and we were wondering if part of the reason why the culture of the city didn’t bother us was because we live in Seattle. 



Bear with me for a minute. Seattlites are pretty famous for being cold and distant, particularly contrasting with the rest of the northwest which is so friendly. When walking the streets of Seattle no one smiles, makes eye contact, or chats unless you specifically need something or know someone. I remember it bothered me a lot when I first moved there, but I don’t really notice it anymore. It’s not personal, and I don’t take it that way. I only notice when I go home to Idaho and realize how friendly everyone is. 



Seattle also stinks and is dirty. Sure, it’s gorgeous with the mountains, lakes, and Puget sound, but it also smells like urine and has a large and uncared for homeless population. Aneta actually mentioned that she lived in the US for a few years and loved it, but that she felt more afraid walking around US cities because drug use was so prevalent and she would see people mumbling or yelling to no one on the streets. I usually feel safe in Seattle, but I have to admit that she’s not wrong. Those experiences happen to me weekly in downtown Seattle, and never happened in Paris. If you have an opinion on this, let me know. 



After our little excursions we hopped on train and headed to Belgium. There was a brief moment of complete panic at the Brussels train station when we had to change trains and were told the wrong gate for our train to Bruges, but we were able to recover and arrive in Bruges no worse for wear. We took a cab from the train station to our hotel (which, has a bath tub. I repeat: IT HAS A BATH TUB!!!!!!), and as we headed into the historic downtown it was clear that Bruges had exploded with Christmas. Which is awesome. We were so tired that we ate dinner and went to bed, but I promise some pics of this beautiful and historic Belgium city tomorrow.
