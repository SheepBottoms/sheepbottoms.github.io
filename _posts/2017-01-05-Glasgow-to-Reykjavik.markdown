I’m afraid I don’t have very much to say about today, or very many pictures. We slept in at our very comfortable hotel in Glasgow, and really only had time to go on a quick morning walk and talk about what to do next time we come to Glasgow before heading to the airport. Here is the building of the modern art gallery. The statues have traffic cones on their heads. We think it’s a “thing” but it was never explained to us so we don’t know. Let me know if you do.

My favorite thing about walking around Glasgow was the window art in the shops. Like this one of a reindeer full of Scotch whisky. You can see the stopper in the antler.

And who knows what this is, but it’s on sale.

Lovely George Square. It was amazing lit up at night, but I can’t find those pictures.

After our walk we headed to the Glasgow airport, which I have to saw was awesome. It was very quiet and calming, and their security checks were ridiculously streamlined. It inspired a lot of confidence in me.
When we landed in Iceland at 3:30, dusk was already starting to fall. It took about 45 minutes to get from the airport into Reykjavik, so by the time we settled in our Airbnb it was dark outside. In the winter, Reykjavik gets about 4 hours sunlight, so it basically looks like the sun rises and falls.

Our BnB was on a quiet street right off Laugavegur, which is the main shopping and eating street in Reykjavik. I had three things in mind for our very short time in Iceland: Hike a glacier, got to the Blue Lagoon, and buy an Icelandic sweater. My plan for this night was to go find one. I checked every shop, and finally decided that I just don’t like traditional Icelandic sweaters. Sad day.

We had a traditional Icelandic dinner at a lovely restaurant, then wondered and looked at Christmas lights. Gorgeous, but again, I have no idea what happened to the pics. That’s all for now. Look forward to glacier pics tomorrow.

Good night.
