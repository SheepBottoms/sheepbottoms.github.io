We are so sad that we didn’t plan to spend more time in York. It is such a cute city, and really has so much to offer.

First a bit about our accommodations. In London we stayed in an AirBnB studion apartment located on the 4th floor of a building right next to the British museum. It was an amazing location, but the actual apartment barely fit the bed, let alone our suitcases, and the shower was only ours to use but was down on the first floor. Every morning we drug ourselves up and down those stairs to get ready. It was a bit inconvenient.
We show up to York, and our bed and breakfast is amazing. It was called No 21 Guest Accommodations, and is run by a lovely couple who worked in the hotel business for a long time. The owner, Simon, stated, “We wanted to create the type of place that had all the things we would want when traveling.” He and his wife delivered. Our room was at the top (more stairs, sigh) and had an incredible view of the York city skyline and York Minster. 
This is the view as the sun was rising.

I know it’s hard to tell in the picture, but it was pretty magical. 

They also included hot cocoa (with fresh milk in the fridge) and biscotti made by a local bakery.

I know that I’m getting very off track here, but even the towels were magic. So big and fluffy. The breakfast was made to order and absolutely incredible, and Simon was amazing in helping us make the most of our limited time. Really, we just wanted to hang out in our comfy room, drink cocoa, and watch British TV.
Another side tangent: British TV. It’s the bomb. We watched part of the nature show about a Scottish man who explores arctic areas and learns about how animals survive there. He pronounced the word geyser like “geezer”. So fun to listen to. At one point I was in bathroom and I hear Jimmy say, “Paige, you have to come see this. They’re showing a bunch of monkeys in a giant bathtub. Sure enough, I looked at the TV and they were highlighting monkeys who stay warm by hopping in a hot springs and taking a bath all day. Sounds lovely.
Ok, tangents over. Back to York. 

York is amazing. We easily could have spent a week there. There were lots of cute little shops, the minster was spectacular and home to more medieval glass than the rest of England combined, and (as I said in my previous post) it is famous for chocolate and beer. Simon told us that there are so many pubs in York, that you could go to a different pub every night for nearly two years. Pubs were last night, though. This morning was all about chocolate.

Those who know me know that I started planning this trip almost a year and a half ago. One of the first things I heard about while doing research on York, was a chocolatier called The Cocoa House, which specializes in all things chocolate. Obviously we had to go. It was so tasty. I got a hot chocolate with a recipe that dates back to the 1600’s, and a cherry chocolate scone.

Just like heaven.

We also walked through a park that has grown up around the ruins of St. Mary’s Abbey. It was even more beautiful than St. Dunstan’s in the East, because it was so much larger.

Our bed and breakfast had purchased a season pass for some of the sites in York, including the Minster, so we got to see it for free. It was lovely.

We had to catch a train for Edinburgh at 12:30pm, so our time was short. We did one last walk around the Shambles area of town, then headed to catch our train.

We tried to walk on the city walls, but due to the plunging temperatures the night before (we had been enjoying 50 degree weather which all of a sudden dove to 20 degree weather), the walls were slick and had been closed for the day. We’ll have to do it when we return.

We were so sad to be leaving York so soon, but there was a lot planned for Edinburgh so we hopped on our train, and headed North.

We had another train ride that felt more beautiful than any train ride I had ever been on. 
A fun thing about this train ride, is that we went through a town called Berwick-Upon-Tweed. We saw the town, with the Tweed river flowing right through the middle.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image46.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image46.jpeg)

 That was interesting to me, because those who knew me before I got married, know that my last name used to be Tweedy. That is an Americanized version of the Scottish Tweedie, which was a powerful Scottish clan in the medieval times. 

Sir Walter Scott traveled around the Scottish borderlands, writing down all of the myths and tales that had popped up about the local clan tribes, and one myth that he wrote about was how the Tweedie clan came into existence. According to his preface of his book “The Betrothed”, there was a young woman whose older husband went away to fight in the crusades for many years. When returned there was a young boy calling the woman “mom”, and the boy was too young to be the man’s child. When asked where the child came from, the woman stated that she was walking by the river Tweed, a river spirit emerged from the water, and next thing you know here’s this kid with bright, blue eyes. The man decided to keep the child, and named him Tweedie. And that’s the legend of my family.

When we arrived in Edinburgh, we hit the ground running. Edinburgh is an incredibly beautiful city, right from the moment you get off the train. The Waverly Train Station it situated right in the middle between the old city and the new, so you can see all of the sites of the city from there including the castle and the Sir Walter Scott monument. No pics of that area because we were dragging all of our stuff around, but it was so beautiful. 

Jimmy had promised that I could buy a tweed jacket while Scotland (yes, I hear the irony in a Tweedy wearing tweed. Let’s all move on). We went to Walker Slater in the Grassmarket area of town and I got a beautiful burgundy jacket. Pics of that to come.

On our way to the shop we took a “wrong turn” and ended up with this amazing view of the castle. It sits on an extinct volcano. How amazing is that?

Here’s the Grassmarket at night.

After getting the jacket we decided to grab dinner before getting on with some evening plans we had. I had read a lot in blogs about a place called The Devil’s Advocate, which was supposed to have amazing food in a really cool setting. I figured they would full, but we decided to try. The restaurant is tucked away in Advocates close, which has a beautiful view of the Sir Walter Scott Monument in the distance.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image49.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image49.jpeg)

When we walked in, we happened to catch the manager who stated that he had just had a cancellation for a party of two, and showed us to a table immediately. The food was incredible, and the setting was pretty fun. We also noticed a decided shift in people becoming a lot more friendly than in England. Jimmy noted that Dublin will always have a special place in our hearts, but Edinburgh was sure giving it a run for its money.

From there, it was time for us to join in on our evening plans, which were to help the City of Edinburgh kick off their three day New Year’s Celebration called Hogmanay. They kick it off each year with a Torchlight procession through the streets of Edinburgh, leading from the Royal Mile to Calton hill, where they set off fireworks. Did I mention that the procession is led by Vikings and a bagpipe brigade? Because it is.
We all got torches, and marched through the streets. The only bad thing about it was that it was kind of a windy night, so as the torches burnt up pieces of burning wax flew through the air and all over us and our clothes. 

This is us with our torches, waiting for our turn to light them.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image52.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image52.jpeg)

You can see that the people in front of us were getting theirs lit, and were working on passing the flames back.

Finally our turn. That is Jimmy’s arm reaching to light his torch.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image56.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image56.jpeg)

And passing his flame to me and those around us.

Can I just point out that between shopping and the procession we had not had time to go back to our apartment, so this me trying to keep my new jacket protected from torch wax. Mission was successful. My wool coat is a whole different story.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image61.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image61.jpeg)

The bagpipers. I never got a good picture of the Vikings. Sorry

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image62.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image62.jpeg)

I got freaked out when my torch got smaller and all the embers started flying on me, so I doused it out early, but Jimmy kept his going until the end of the march. Getting pretty small here.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image63.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image63.jpeg)

At the end on Calton Hill.

Such an incredible experience. Here’s a view of the city from the top of the hill.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image71.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161230/image71.jpeg)

At that point we were feeling amazing and felt like it was such an incredible experience. A few minutes later we realized that we were on top of a hill an hour long walk from our apartment with thousands of other people. NO cabs to be had, no Ubers to be had. The walk home was slightly less euphoric. 
Amazing news, though, our apartment here has a bathtub! Wonderful for tired, swollen feet.
Good night.
