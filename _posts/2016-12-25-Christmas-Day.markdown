Merry Christmas! Today was magical, mainly because we got to sleep in. So much sleep.

Transportation and sites were all closed for the holiday today, and I had really expected London to be deserted. I was wrong. Everywhere we went we saw tons of people marching around the city in tour groups. Trafalgar square was nuts. Luckily, I had planned ahead.

I really planned for Christmas to be a rest day, but we had a Christmas lunch booked at Victorian pub, and were planning to do a Charles Dickens walking tour of London.

Lunch was so fun and tasty. The pub was called The Wellington, and looked very festive.

They even provided us with Christmas crackers, which is a Christmas tradition in England. You pull them, and out pops a hat, a silly joke, and a little toy.

I got a fortune telling fish, which told me I was fickle over and over and over again. At least I’m steady in my fickleness.

Jimmy got a puzzle, which he worked really hard to figure out.

With no success. He looked it up online and found that there was a whole Reddit thread about how frustrating this puzzle is for people, because there is a manufacturing flaw that makes it impossible. Poor Jimmy.

We also enjoyed our crowns.

And our meal was epic.

Jimmy got some kind of a traditional Christmas pudding. It tasted like fruitcake to me.
After we were nice and full, it was time to walk around London and learn about where Charles Dickens got his inspiration.

We started in Trafalgar Square.

We saw a bunch of sites, but the guide moved so quickly that I really couldn’t take pictures. I did get one of the Charles Dickens coffee house, which I think is right below a place where he lived.

And we ended at Covent Garden, which looked amazing.

The light decorations there were hanging mistletoe.

We also saw this lovely little alleyway.

Then we went back to our BnB, and ate a bunch of caramels.

Good night.
