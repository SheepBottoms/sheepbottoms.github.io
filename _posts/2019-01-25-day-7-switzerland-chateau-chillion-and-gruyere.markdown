His everyone! Welcome to our first full day in Switzerland! Today we decided to rent a car and drove around the cute little Swiss villages from Bern to Montreux and back. 

We began in Bern, finding breakfast and heading to the car rental agency. Here’s the cute little door on our Airbnb:

The neighborhood we’re staying in is very cute and family friendly, but also very residential. Here’s some colorful apartment homes nearby.

We walked through a little park, and I noticed that the Swiss only have wiener dogs

Just kidding, of course. Actually, the Swiss have lots of dogs, and the dogs go everywhere with their owners. We’ve seen them on trams, in restaurants and bars, and in most tourist sights. Pretty fun.

Here’s some lovely building in Bern

And across the street is the US embassy

A bit of an eyesore. Sorry Switzerland!

We stopped by a coffee shop to grab breakfast, and the young men “working” seemed really surprised to us. They were actually playing cards. An older man also seemed to surprised to see us, and stated “We actually have really good coffee. Like from Italy or something.” They were also blaring some kind of Eastern European rap music. After leaving, we mulled over whether or not we had just supported some kind of mob front. The coffee actually was pretty good, though.

Across the street was a bakery that looked way more legit, and we bought some amazing bread, and some Swiss shortbread cookies filled with different fillings for the road. Then we hit the road.

So, obviously Switzerland is gorgeous. I’m always so frustrated that pictures never do the places justice.

We found ourselves in an incredibly beautiful, sunny day. We crossed the countryside and into the mountains.

And back down into a valley overlooking lake Geneva.

And it was amazing

We wandered through Montreux

And to the very lovely Chateau Chillon.

Jimmy taking a picture of the mountains and the lake. He must have deleted that picture because I can’t find it.

They were having special exhibits all about Medieval wine and food.

Medieval wall paper

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId43.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId43.jpg)

Not quite mannequins, but pretty close

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId44.jpg)

And Medieval toilets! But no mannequins

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId45.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId45.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId46.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId46.jpg)



So I acted it out for you. This was right before I saw that the “toilet” was just a hole going all the way down to the water. Pretty hard to get comfy.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId47.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId47.jpg)

Also, the exhibit had medieval artwork about toilets, which was apparently a thing

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId48.jpg)

How scary is this dude? We were alone in the room, and Jimmy kept making jokes about it moving. Creepy mannequin. Check

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId58.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId58.jpg)

We went into the dungeons where they had a projector set up with creepy projections of previously inmates. Jimmy tried to give them bunny ears

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId59.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId59.jpg)

And we found how to get to the top, just as a bunch of schoolkids also did.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId60.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId60.jpg)

The views were pretty great

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId62.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId62.jpg)

Jimmy also found a cannon! It’s been a while

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId63.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId63.jpg)

There’s a giant clock on the outside, and these are the gears that make it move

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId64.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId64.jpg)

Jimmy also found armor

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId65.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20190125/imagerId65.jpg)

And I found a dress. In the gift shop. I could have bought this.

At that point is was time to head out a get lunch. We had spent so long at the castle, that we were starving. My original plan was to head to Gruyere and eat yummy fondue for lunch, but it was 45 minutes away and we weren’t going to make it. So we caved and ate at . . . McDonalds. It was the only thing we could take to go on our way to the highway.

To go to Gruyere, we headed back into the mountains

Gruyere is famous for its cheese, and it was also part of the “grand tour” of Europe that British people used to take

It also has a museum for the movie “Alien”. I guess the director spent some time here.

They also have an “Alien” themed bar that looks like you’re inside a creature. I mean, it’s cool, but also pretty random. And I’ve never seen the movie so completely lost on me.

By that point we were losing light, and had one more place to go.

And we ended up here: at La Bains Gruyere.

 They basically built swimming pools, a sauna, and a hammam around a natural hot springs. It had a beautiful view, and you don’t have to be naked which is a plus for us. We got to sit in the warm water and watch the sunset over the alps. No cameras allowed in the hot springs, so that memory is just for us.

Here’s the cute town it’s in

Oh, I almost forgot. At the Chateau, we got a parking ticket! We’re 90% sure we weren’t actually parked illegally, but it seems like it doesn’t really matter. Jimmy’s first international parking ticket.

We made it back to Bern around dark, and went scouring for food. We parked downtown, and were told that we were parked illegally (again?). We moved to parking garage, where I found this

And we headed to a pub for food, where we proceeded to have an unexpectedly strange evening. The pub was pretty full when we walked in, but a couple of men in their 70’s offered to let us sit at their table. They spoke English, and were excited to tell us about Zermatt (another town we’re going to). 

The bar was super smoky, as were our dinner partners. We woke up the next morning still smelling like smoke. In general, we’ve been really surprised to see more smoking in Switzerland than France. I thought the Swiss were really health-conscious. 

The evening got weird when a third friend showed up, red faced and clearly already inebriated. He told us he was a English teacher, but he had the weirdest accent I’ve ever heard. At first we thought he was from London, because the accent and language were decidedly cockney. He told us he was native to Bern, and we were concerned about the kind of English he was teaching. He made a bunch of super inappropriate jokes, and Jimmy remarked later that he was “working really hard for his title of dirty old man.” 

Shortly after he showed up, we decided it was time to head out. After driving around for forever looking for a gas station that was still open, we returned the rental car and crawled into bed. 

We’re looking forward to our day tomorrow, spending some time in Bern and heading into the Alps!

Good night.
