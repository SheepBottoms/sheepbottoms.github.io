In England, the day after Christmas is a national holiday in it’s own right. It’s called Boxing Day, and it is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. Most people flock into London to enjoy some of the best shopping in the world, on the best shopping day of the year.

We travel with nothing but a backpack and carry on each, which means that I need to limit my shopping and purchasing or I will have to start leaving things behind.

With that in mind, we decided to escape the craziness of London and head to the English countryside for the day. I don’t plan many guided tours when we travel, because I love to do the research and plan things myself, but in a trip this long I will usually plan one or two tours to give myself a break. On a guided tour we don’t have to navigate, or worry about where to go or where to eat. We just sit back and let someone else do all the work.

This is a side note, but we took an Uber Victoria to meet up with the tour, and we ended up getting stuck behind some royal horses who getting their morning exercise.

In the second picture they are turning into some back gates into Buckingham palace.

Although we’ve done guided tours before, they’ve always been pretty small. This guided tour was giant. We were in a double decker bus, and the bus was completely full. At one point we were told that there were 80 people on the tour. So much for escaping the crowds; we brought them with us.

Our guide was an older gentleman who wore an overcoat, bright red scarf, and a top hat. He looked like Scrooge from a Christmas carol. He had a very dry sense of humor which was fun, but I never seen anyone so stressed out about anything. This man must have been exhausted by the end of the day because he spent the whole time worrying.

We started the tour by traveling to Windsor castle, which is the favorite residence of Queen Elizabeth. The royal family is somewhere else for Christmas, but we took a little walk around the town.

The best part was that they gave us juice and cookies at the wishing well. My wish came true!

Then, there was more exploring.

Notice the santa hats on the shrubbery. SO cute!

There’s Scrooge in the top hat.

We had another day of incredible weather.

A picture where we blocked the castle with our bodies, so you can’t tell where we are. Awesome. Love these. Thanks fellow tourists.

We were then herded back on the bus (I use the term “herded” genuinely, because the guide actually waved his arms and ran alongside us making sure we were all moving forward) and we headed off to Stonehenge. Which was gorgeous.

Our tour provided us with our entry ticket (no waiting in line was pretty awesome) and an audio guide. It was incredibly stressful for our guide to make sure everyone had their tickets and audio guides, but it eventually happened and off we all went.

It was a beautiful day, but it was very windy so I wonder if the weather scared some people away. It was busy, but not overly crowded.

If you’ve never been to Stonehenge, the audio guide was actually really good. Not too hokey, and with great information. The middle is roped off to keep you from walking around inside, because it’s important to someone to protect this ancient site. 

Jimmy’s thoughts on this: “I think it’s good that they’re trying to protect it. Preserving a bunch of giant stones on top of a mud pit seems like kind of an uphill battle.”
Words of wisdom.

What they do let you do is walk around the entire circumference. Here are pictures from all angles.

Would you like a side of bog bodies with your Stonehenge? No?

We also saw English sheep for the first time.

The back part of the structure is pretty cool, because a lot of the stones have fallen down so you can really see inside the structure.

This may be the most amazing picture ever taken. I just couldn’t delete it. Nailed it!

I don’t really know why, but Jimmy loved the crows. He kept saying, “They look different than American crows. They’re so cool.” I couldn’t really tell the difference, but he really seemed to like them so I took a picture. You’re welcome, Jimmy.

At the end of our audio guide we were asked to stand and contemplate the meaning of life, yadda yadda yadda. Jimmy really took it seriously.

After Stonehenge, we all shuffled back on the bus and went to lunch at a pub. Lunch was lovely, but this was yet another very stressful event for our guide.

After lunch we had an hour long drive to Bath. Our guide was very concerned that we all took too long to eat and may not get daylight time in Bath, but he didn’t need to be worried. Bath was gorgeous.

Guys, this is where Jane Austen lived. I’m not even kidding.

After that we were all herded back on the bus, and made our way back home. We were right on time.
Good night.
