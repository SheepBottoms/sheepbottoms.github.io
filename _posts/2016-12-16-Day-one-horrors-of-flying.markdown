Today was very exciting. We literally spent all day Friday flying on airplane for 9 hours. Enjoy the pictures.


Jimmy and me before we left Seattle. Here we come, brave new world!

The flight was boring, and since we booked through a third party booking site our seat reservations were changed when we arrived at the airport, meaning that we did not sit together. No worries, there's nothing they can do. I did get to sit by what seemed like a lovely teenage girl and her mom, but when I take my anti-anxiety medication I often donâ€™t remember chunks of time and can be a little . . . unhibited.  Hopefully I was generally appropriate.
