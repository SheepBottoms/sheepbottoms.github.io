Today was very exciting. We literally spent all day Friday flying on airplane for 9 hours. Enjoy the pictures.

The flight was boring, and since we booked through a third party booking site or seat reservations were changed when we showed up, meaning that we need did not sit together. I did get to sit by what seemed like a lovely teenage girl and her mom, but when I take my anti anxiety medication I often donâ€™t remember chunks of time. Hopefully I was generally appropriate.
