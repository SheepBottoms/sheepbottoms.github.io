Hello everyone! We woke up today feeling pretty refreshed after our wild night. I also found an amazing trick for getting melted wax off of wool coats. Did you know that you can heat up on iron, put down a paper towel on top the wax stain and rub the iron over it? The paper towel soaks of the now remelted wax, and it doesn’t leave a stain. Incredible!

We were able to get up early enough that we hit the streets before most other people were awake. We got some pictures of the city as we walked to Hula Juice bar for breakfast.

Edinburgh is a seriously beautiful city, and it was fun to see it fairly empty in the morning. After breakfast we headed straight to castle to tour it before everyone else woke up. It seemed like there must have been some serious partying the night before, because at 10am it was pretty empty.
It was also incredibly windy in the morning, so that may have also kept people away.

View from the walkway up to the castle.

Inside, the castle had amazing views and lots to see.

Jimmy found another cannon.

This one pointed out to the city. Straight at the Ferris wheel

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image19.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image19.jpeg)

Just like in England, we headed straight for the crown jewels first. The Scottish crown jewels are interesting because they are older than England’s, and there is only one set. They include a crown, a sword, a scepter, and a stone. The stone is said to be the same one that Scottish kings have been crowned on since the 10th century. Pretty amazing. No pics allowed though.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image20.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image20.jpeg)

The walkway to the crown jewels tells the story of the jewels and the history of royalty in Scotland. Jimmy and I were both very excited to see . . . Mannequins!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image21.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image21.jpeg)

England’s historical spots were cool, but sadly lacking in mannequins. On the other hand, Edinburgh castle had a sign advertising “historical latrines”, but when you went inside it was an empty room. No toilet, no mannequins, sad day.

You can tour some of the castle rooms.

And the outside.

At 11:30, it was advertised that someone would be in the Great Hall to do a weapons demonstration. We happened to find ourselves in the Great Hall at just the right time. Here’s the demonstrator marching in.

The castle also has an really beautiful memorial building to honor soldiers lost in the line of duty. Jimmy really liked the lion statue. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image27.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image27.jpeg)

There are no pictures allowed in the memorial because it is a sacred place, but it is truly lovely. Definitely go in if you ever find yourself at the castle.
More pictures of the castle.

Jimmy in a dungeon, demonstrating to me that there is totally enough light to take a picture there. He was right, and his face says it all.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image31.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image31.jpeg)

And right around midday, the hoards descended upon the castle, so we headed out in search of lunch.

Which we found at Oink, a Scottish hog roast restaurant. They roast a hog, and serve it on sandwiches with stuffing and your choice of sauce. Jimmy did BBQ, and I did apple sauce. Both were amazing.

After lunch we took a bit of a detour to the mall to hit a store called Superdry that Jimmy really loves. He got a new coat that he’s really excited about, so if you notice it in a picture make his day and give me a shout out.

We wandered over the Elephant House, which is where JK Rowling spent time writing Harry Potter. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image45.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image45.jpeg)

Then we headed to Holyrood Palace, which is the home of her Majesty the Queen in Scotland. 
On the way we stopped by Cadenheads Whisky shop, that sells Scotch whisky from a cask that you can only buy in Edinburgh.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image46.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image46.jpeg)

I didn’t get a picture of him, but they also have a Scottie dog that runs around the place. So cute.
We toured the palace, and the audio guide was actually fantastic. We got to see the Mary Queen of Scots rooms as well, and got there late in the evening so there weren’t very many people. No pics allowed inside the palace, but the outside is lovely too.

You can also take pictures in an abbey outside.

After that we went back to apartment to rest and change, then hit the town for dinner. I had made reservations at a tavern called The Doric, and they served us a fantastic meal. We got to try steak from the Scottish Borderlands, and a liquor called Drumbuie made from Scotch whisky, honey, and spices. The recipe is said to date back to the days of bonny Prince Charlie, and has been kept very secret. It was very tasty.
We were also told that crackers are New Years tradition as well as Christmas, so we got to do them all over again. I got a pirate eye patch and Jimmy got a very small cookie cutter.

And there was amazing dessert of sticky toffee pudding and some kind of a baked pear.

But the night was just beginning
After dinner we headed off the ring in the New Year at the Edinburgh Hogmanay street party.

Jimmy and I have been to a lot of rock concerts and festivals, but we have never seen anything like this. Alcohol was EVERYWHERE. The trashcans were overflowing with bottles, and people just left bottles on ledges and corners. That being said, people were having a lot of fun. We definitely ran into some frighteningly drunk people, but most people were friendly and just having fun. Jimmy and I aren’t big drinkers, and the line for the porta potties was terrifying long so we didn’t take in any liquids.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image62.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image62.jpeg)

They had bands with different types of music playing on four different stages around the city, and they had small firework displays every hour.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image65.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image65.jpeg)

We got to see a new band that we really love play.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image66.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20161231/image66.jpeg)

Then headed to the traditional music stage to so some Scottish dancing and do the countdown. The fireworks display over the castle at midnight was the best I’ve ever seen, then everyone joined hands and danced around in circle singing Auld Lang Syne.

It was such a cool experience. If you ever get the chance to celebrate Hogmanay in Edinburgh, don’t think twice, it’s worth it.

At that point we were feeling our fatigue, and headed home on foot. All along the way people were singing and dancing in the streets, and everyone was wishing each other happy new year. Feeling delightfully tired, we have headed to bed.

Happy Hogmanay, everyone!

Good night.
