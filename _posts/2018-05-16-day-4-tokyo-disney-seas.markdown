We made it! I have been so excited to visit Tokyo Disney ever since Jimmy and I made the deal that if we came to Japan (his idea) we would dedicate a day to Disney. In my family (meaning my mom, sister, and I) take Disney very seriously. Leading up to the trip I was researching blogs on Tokyo Disney, and my sister was sending me links to all of the important information for planning the trip.

Tokyo Disney resort is centered around two Disney parks, one that is a traditional Disneyland, and one called Disney Sea which is kind of like California Adventure, but nothing even remotely like California adventure. We had heard good things about both parks, but bloggers seemed to fairly unanimously agree that Disney Sea was the best park in the whole Disney franchise, throughout the whole world. Since we’d been to Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida, we decided to mix it up and try Disney Sea. 

Although bloggers agreed Disney Sea was amazing, I had also heard horror stories of how busy it can get. I’ve seen pictures of streets so crowded you can’t walk, and lines for rides that can take hours. I hit the research hard, and created a plan that I hoped would be our best bet for minimizing crowds and maximizing enjoyment of this unique experience of Disney magic. 

The short story: mission accomplished. We had a great time. Keep reading for the long story.

Y research indicated that going on a weekend day would be miserable, so we chose a Tuesday. There is also a series of national vacation days in Japan that all fall on the same week in May. They call is Golden week, and it is supposed to be the most miserable time of all to go to Tokyo Disney. That week hit the week before our trip, so I was hoping everyone would be back working the grind. 

We stayed at a budget hotel that was a little way away from the parks, but had a free shuttle to get us there before opening time. We got there about 30 minutes before opening, and there were already lines forming, but not as bad I thought. We bought our tickets and hopped in line.

The gates opened, and Mickey and Minnie were there to great up with a band.

Honestly, I thought it would be weird to hear all the characters speaking Japanese, but you got used to it quickly. Disney magic can be communicated in any language, you really don’t have to understand it.

This globe is the famous symbol of the Disney Sea entrance.

Behind the globe you can see the beginning of Mediterranean Harbor. Disney Sea is divided into different “lands” just like other Disney parks. You enter into Mediterranean harbor which is a replica of Italy, in particular Venice. 

Just part of the hoard trying to get to the park.

When we entered the park, we decided to breeze right by this land, and head to some more popular rides that we knew might have long wait times later one. Two of Disney Sea’s main rides were closed for maintenance, so we didn’t get to ride Tower of Terror or a Disney Sea original Journey to the Center of the Earth. Everything else was running, though, and Disney Sea is possibly most famous for it’s assortment of delectable snacks. We took full advantage of that. 

We started out heading back to the far corner of the park to ride one my favorite classic rides Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones was located in an area called The Lost River Delta, which is similar to adventure land, but different. Get used to that description. 

While heading to the LRD we passed by Mysterious Island which is located in the middle of the park, and has Mount Vesuvius as its centerpiece.

The crowds thinned out once we got passed Mysterious island, as most people were heading to the American waterfront to hop in line for the most popular Disney Sea ride Toy Story Mania. The blogs stated that it was just like the one at Disney World, so we decided to skip it this trip.  When everyone else was headed to the left, we headed right and found ourselves almost alone in the park.

As we were walking a women with two little girls in princess dresses came up to us and frantically asked, “Is this the way to Mermaid Lagoon?” We were excited to know where we were going for a change, and hoped that her level of desperation would decrease once her kids met Ariel.

We kept walking to Indiana Jones. This ride was focused on the movie The Crystal Skull, so it had some differences to the original, but still had the classic park with the rolling boulder. We didn’t wait at all to get on, and rode it twice.

Next up, Jimmy rode the only rollercoaster in the park, and I FaceTimed my sister and took her on a journey through another land in the park Mermaid Lagoon. Mermaid Lagoon is centered around The Little Mermaid, and is wonderfully colorful. It’s really for little kids, but I enjoyed myself as the visual effects were dazzling.

While I was FaceTiming my sister I ran into Goofy who did a little dance for her, and took a picture with me.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId29.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId29.jpg)

At that point my sister had to put my niece to bed, and I got a text that Jimmy was off his roller coaster and looking for me. I emerged from the deep. One more pic on the outside. That’s it. I promise.

Our next stop was to the Disney Exclusive ride 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea on Mysterious Island. Here’s what Mysterious Island looks like:

The ride was pretty cool. You get on a submarine pod (we had ours to ourselves) and they use effects to make it look like you’re going under water. Lots of adventures ensue. In Japanese.

Back on the outside, we decided to begin our Disney Sea snack pilgrimage. I documented it all on Facebook, so the only snack I’ll put here is the first one. They were all amazing, mainly because most of them are dumplings, and who doesn’t love a good dumpling?

Oops, another one of Mermaid Lagoon snuck in here. My bad.

Up next we headed to the Arabian Coast

That’s the view of Mermaid Lagoon from the Arabian Coast . . . tied it back around. Last one. Most likely.

Tokyo Disney is famous for it’s popcorn stands. They have stands all over the park, and each stand is a different flavor. You can buy popcorn in a collectible case, and refill it at all of the stations. Bloggers agreed that it was a giant gimmick and waste of money, but also stated that the pull for the popcorn is strong in park. We passed this one by.

As we explored the streets we found Jafar, and pondered mischief.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId50.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId50.jpg)

Well, I did. Jimmy didn’t get the mischief memo.

We also saw Aladin with Jasmine. Very cute.

Jimmy refused to slow down so I could get my picture with Aladin. I think he was intimidated.

A Disney Sea original ride in the Arabian Coast is called Sinbad’s Storybook Adventure. It is an animatronic doll ride in the vein of It’s a Small World, but with less annoying music. It’s all in Japanese, so not super clear on the story, but it was fun to see and Sinbad’s Tiger friend Chandu was a lovable character.

Back on the outside we found Abu rifling through people’s backpacks. He took a break for a quick pic.

The famous Chandu Tail snack. This is a dumpling bun with curried something or another inside. Very tasty.

After our snack break we headed down a different area of The Lost River Delta. I was excited to see CoCo represented.

And we made our way to Port Discovery in search of the Nemo and friends ride.

There was a bit of a wait, so we grabbed fast passes for it and headed to the Aquatopia ride.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId67.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId67.jpg)

I was really wanting this ride to be bumper boats, but it was on a track. It was still pretty fun as it turned and twisted you around in the water.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId68.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId68.jpg)

Nemo and Friends Sea Rider is the newest attraction at Disney Sea. It’s in the style of the Star Tours ride, but you go Underwater instead in of in space. I loved it and had so much fun. Jimmy got seasick . . . even though we weren’t actually in water. Sad day.

As you can see in that last picture, the park was starting to fill up, but it still wasn’t overwhelming, and we hadn’t waited more than 15 minutes for any ride.

We decided to head over to the American Waterfront to get tickets for one of the shows Disney Seas puts on, Big Band Beat. Here’s the view.

On the way over we happened upon a water parade. It wasn’t on the English schedule, so I have no idea what it was about, but when you’re at Disney Sea and happen upon a water parade you stop and watch.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId79.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId79.jpg)

We checked out Toy Story Mania, which had a wait time of nearly an hour and a half. No thanks.

I then made the biggest mistake of our Tokyo Disney experience. I gave into the pull of popcorn, and bought a Duffy popcorn holder filled with chocolate popcorn.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId82.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId82.jpg)

Straight up, I don’t even know who Duffy is. I just know that he’s a Japanese phenomenon that must have something to do with Disney. That carrying case is HUGE, which Jimmy noticed immediately, but kept to himself until I’d bought it. I spent the rest of my Disney Sea experience dragging around Duffy, and now he’s shoved in my backpack taking up more space than he deserves. But I digress.

We ate some lunch at the New York Deli, and ended up winning our lottery to attend the show. Everyone in the Biglietteria was very excited for us. We had some time to kill before the show, so we wandered the Mediterranean Coast.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId84.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId84.jpg)

Which actually did feel surprisingly like Venice.

After that we found another parade on the water, this one starring Duffy.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId89.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/16/imagerId89.jpg)

We left the parade and headed to the Big Band Beats show, which was an American Jazz show with a full swing style band, tap dancing, and 100% in English. The show was great and the performers brought a lot of energy that made it believable. Also, Mickey Mouse actually played the drums. Didn’t just pretend to play them, actually played them. And he was on fire. Despite all the theatrics on the stage, the crowd was very subdued. The Japanese culture is very quiet, and even while the actors and singers were dancing and shouting, the crowd politely clapped after each song. Jimmy and I were in a bit of shock.

After the show we made friends with a duck who REALLY wanted my Donald Duck dumpling.




Then we wandered a cool Disney Sea experience called the Fortress Exploration, where we got to explore a castle.

The castle was awesome, but it was really hot, so we opted to go to the other Disney Sea Show, Out of Shadowland. It was a great show complete with aerialists, singing, amazing dancing, and some great light effects. It was in Japanese but it was so visual that it really didn’t matter that we couldn’t understand what they were saying. 

After the show we grabbed dinner at one of the Italian restaurants because it just felt so good to change up the culinary experience a bit.

We staked out our spots on the waterfront for the Fantasmic water show, which was a lot like the versions in the US except, you know, in Japanese. We were struck by how everyone lines up in neat little rows, and listened diligently to instructions from Disney cast members. So different than the anarchy and chaos that happens around Fantasmic in the US.

We ended our night riding on a Venetian Gondola, which was oh so lovely.

Throughout the day we had gotten so used to not understanding people’s words, that as the Gondolier gave his Disney spiel we basically ignored him, smiled at him, and enjoyed the scenery. At one point we  look over at him and he is looking at us excitedly. It took us a minute to realize that he had said an English word, and was waiting for us to respond. He said “wish” and pointed at the bridge we were going under, and we assumed were supposed to make a wish while crossing under it since everyone else in the boat was sitting with their eyes closed. I won’t tell what I wished for, or it won’t come true.

Good night.
