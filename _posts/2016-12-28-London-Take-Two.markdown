Jimmy and I learned a lot from our stressful day yesterday. Christmas crowds are the worst. Seriously. THE WORST.

Over dinner, Jimmy and I talked about the other time we were in a place that was so crowded it became unfun: Venice three years ago. Don’t get me wrong, Venice was awesome. But the crowds there were not. Back then, we were ready for it. We got up early and hit big sites right when they opened, took a nap in the afternoon when crowds were so thick you couldn’t walk, then went back out in late afternoon/evening. We decided to rearrange all of our London plans and implement that policy. Luckily, I had booked an afternoon tea experience that I was really excited about, so the afternoon crowds were already taken care of.

At the advice of Rick Steves and my extremely well travelled sister, we got up before the sun and headed straight to the tower of London. So incredible!

We got there before it opened, but already a line was forming to get in. We hopped in line, and when they opened the gates we practically ran to the building that houses the Crown Jewels, which is in the very back to the complex. Normally the line to view the crown jewels is as long as the line for the admission, but we were so early that we didn’t have to wait at all. No pics allowed inside, but here’s the building they are housed in.

 We did a quick breeze through, then copying what sister had done on her trip we went back through, taking more time to look at everything. As we were exiting, we noticed that there was already a line forming that went out the door. 

Jimmy seriously wanted to see some armor, so we went to the tower museum to see the medieval armor. When we were in Madrid three years before I literally had to drag Jimmy away from the armor at the Royal Palace. This time, I gave him a time limit, and let him know we would be doing a walking tour with a Yeoman (one of the guards and caretakers of the tower nicknamed “Beefeaters”) in one hour.

The armor was pretty cool, and Jimmy definitely could have spent longer there, but he was pretty quick to leave when I let him know we were out of time. We rushed through the last portion so we saw this cool dragon, but we don’t really know what he’s about.

We also got to view our 4th or 5th display toilet (although I was VERY disappointed that there was no mannequin on it. Apparently England is not as fond of mannequins as Ireland).

And we got some cool views of the tower bridge out a window.

The Beefeater tour was awesome. The guide was funny, and it helped to have someone remind me of all the stories that took place in the tower (most of them ridiculously sad). At one point he asked if there were any Americans in the tour. Quite a few of raised our hands, and he stated, “See, if you had only paid your taxes all this history could be yours too.” Chuckle chuckle.

The gate they would take prisoner’s through to behead them on Tower Hill.

The White tower

After the tour we took a quick walk around, and did some walking on the tour walls. The Tower bridge looked amazing in the morning mist.

We also saw people in medieval garb doing some kind of a dance.

BY that time we noticed that the hoards had descended, and there were lines for everything. It was time to move on. We took a little walk, seeing more lovely views of the bridge.

We walked to a church nearby called St. Dunstan’s in the East. It was a medieval church that burned down in a fire, and was rebuilt by Christopher Wren, only to take significant hits by bombs in the blitz during WWII. Rather than rebuild it again, they left it in ruins and created a garden inside. The church spire with the clock and bell still stands, but the inside is open air and filled with grass and vines. It was lovely even in the winter.

Our next stop was a tube trip to the Sanderson hotel, where I had booked us seats at the Mad Hatter’s Afternoon Tea. Jimmy was thrilled. 

He was an amazing sport, though. Except that he refused pictures.

It was Alice in Wonderland themed, complete with menus in old books, whimsical china, and deserts shaped like characters from the book. We got two types of specialty teas, savory bites, and sweet bites. The food was good, but the sweet bites were incredibly sweet.

It finished with a bottle labeled “drink me” and filled with some kind of an orange dessert. I was worried it make me bigger or smaller, but as far as I know my pant size was the only thing that grew.

After tea we decided to split up. Jimmy wanted to visit the National Gallery, and I was feeling the pressure to get some laundry done and do some souvenir shopping. I got done what I needed to, and my understanding is that Jimmy was eventually asked to leave the National Gallery because it was closing. He had been there over three hours.

In the evening we were very excited to meet up with a friend from my undergraduate days at University of Idaho. On Yee (who went by Angie when she lived in the US, so I still call her by that name) came to U of I from Hong Kong where she grew up, and returned there after graduation. It just so happened that she was in London on holiday with a friend the same time we were. She knew me even before I was dating Jimmy, but we hadn’t seen her in 10 years. We got to meet with her for dinner, and enjoyed real British food at a pub. She let us know that she has been following the blog, so hi again Angie! It was amazing to see you!

After dropping her off at the tube station, we went back to our residence for our last night in one of the quirkiest places I’ve ever stayed (more on that tomorrow). For now
Good night.
