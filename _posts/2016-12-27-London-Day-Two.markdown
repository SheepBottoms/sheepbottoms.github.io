Hi friends and family. Today we had our first real day in London holiday crowds. We thought we were pretty smart to travel to London over the winter when no one else would be here, but we were wrong. Everyone else had the same idea we did.

Today we were supposed to follow a carefully planned itinerary that would allow us to hit Buckingham Palace and thee major sites between Big Ben and Trafalgar square. We were also supposed to use a Rick Steves approved trick to score discounted tickets to a West End theatre play. 
Sounds lovely, doesn’t it? Hmmm.

The day immediately went wrong when we went into a bakery near our place to grab some breakfast to take with us to the changing of the guards at Buckingham palace. We got our food to go, only to try it on the tube and realize that it was awful. No breakfast.
We got to the palace gates about an hour before the changing of the guards was scheduled to begin, and it was already crowded.

All of the spots against the gate were taken, as were spots on the Victoria Monument, which is what Rick Steves recommends. One hour was not enough.

We decided to go ahead and stake a spot, and see what we could. An hour later, and we surrounded by people with selfie sticks and can’t see anything past the crowds all around us.

Hungry and grouchy, I decided that I’m done with that. We heard the band play, and saw some guards marching.

Then we tried to make our way back through the crowd towards Westminster Abbey. 

We found a pub for lunch along the way, which was so lovely, but they were slow to get us our food and by the time we were done with lunch, the crowds had already moved from Buckingham Palace to Westminster.

We got in line, because even though we spent Christmas Eve there, we really didn’t get to tour it. After 40 minutes in the line, we realize we are in the wrong line. I’m not sure what the line we were in was for, but it was not the one we needed.

We go to the other end of the church and look at the actual line, which is colossal by this point. It becomes pretty obvious that we are going to spend our whole day waiting in line. Feeling increasingly grouchy, I decide that I do not want to do that, and instead decide to do the Rick Steve’s Westminster Walk to get pretty views of the city in an attempt to save the day (and myself) from total failure.
Crowds were so thick on the streets, that we could barely even move at a slugs pace through the walk, but we managed to slag a few good pictures anyway.

The day was not being redeemed. 

One more sad tale, then I’ll tell you how we saved it.

We went to the place where Rick Steves advised that we buy discounted tickets for the West End plays. The place was real, but the discounts were not. Seeing Wicked was going to cost us a minimum of 70 pounds each, which is significantly more than we paid to see it in Portland a couple of years ago. There were no other plays we were interested, I schlepped out of the line, and went to find Jimmy, who I had left in Trafalgar Square at the National Gallery. Finding Jimmy, we decided we need to completely regroup. My itinerary was blown out of the water, as was my patience.

After regrouping we decide that the best course of action is to spend the afternoon at the British Library. It was somewhere we both wanted to go, and we would have more time to spend there than if we waited for the next day, when we were scheduled to visit.

The museum was awesome. There were places where lots of people were congregated (the Rosetta stone and the mummies), but the museum was so large that it was easy to find spots with interesting things where we didn’t feel so crowded. 

One of the things I found most interesting in the museum was a room full of things from the Parthenon, which we had visited three years ago. There was a pamphlet in the room about why the British museum was keeping the relics, rather than returning them to Athens. Basically, they accused Greece of being too unstable and stated that they are keeping the relics safe. The museum in Athens told a very different story.

We spent 3 hours in that museum, and Jimmy really could have used another hour. We snuck over to see the mummies at the end, and viewed the Rosetta stone after they had shuffled most people out. It was a great afternoon.
Since we weren’t seeing a play, I wanted to find something special for dinner. I had also promised Jimmy, who loves Indian food more than anyone I have ever met, that we would find some good Indian food in London. I had read a foodie blog that talked about a place called Dishoom, which is marketed as a modern copy of traditional Irani cafes of Bombay. The food was supposed to be amazing, and pretty unique. And it was in Covent Garden, which is one of my favorite neighborhoods of London.
We headed out and enjoyed the amazing lights along the way.

The restaurant has become extremely popular, and we had to wait in a long line, but they fed us chai and mint tea as we waited, and everyone was chatting in line. We finally got our table, and had the best meal we’ve had all trip. 

The waiter totally profiled us and was concerned our ability to handle the spiciness of the food. We loved it. If you go, definitely get the chocolate pudding with chile ice cream. So amazing!
Good night.
