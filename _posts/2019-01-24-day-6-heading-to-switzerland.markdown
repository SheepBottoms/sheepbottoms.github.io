Hi friends. Today was a busy traveling day, which means it’s a bit light on pictures. Which, I think, is a relief for all of us. The last post took me forever.

We started our morning out in Dijon once again, and decided to do their walking trail. The city of Dijon created something they call the “Owl Trail” to help tourists find all of their historic spots. Each historic spot is marked with a number on an owl plaque like this one:

You can read about the plaque on their app (or in a guidebook your Airbnb hosts provides), then follow the little owl arrows, which look like this

To the next stop. This is very cute, and it’s like a treasure hunt to be looking ahead for all of the owls.

Here are some of the historic spots in Dijon

The Notre Dame Cathedral (obviously we liked this one, and it was right behind our Airbnb so we kept walking by it)

The good luck owl. You rub it with your left hand and make a wish

The old mill house which is now a restaurant and gift shop

Notice the cat on the roof

And now some sights that I don’t remember what they are

This courtyard is full of ground fountains kids can play in during the summer. During the winter it’s a bit less exciting

Pigeons!

Ok, I know I said the blog would be light on pictures today, but I had honestly forgotten how many pictures we took. Dijon is so amazing, and you should go see it for yourself if you get the chance.

Moving on, we decided it was time to get packed up and head to the train station to catch our train to Bern, Switzerland. We were sad to be leaving France behind, but very excited to experience a new country. I had been to Switzerland when I was 13, but I don’t remember going to most of the places Jimmy and I will be visiting. My family can chime in and remind me of places we went on that trip.

While Jimmy was packing, I ran to a store to buy some local candies to bring home. I had my arms all loaded up when I realized I didn’t have my wallet. Pretty awkward explaining that to the clerk who only spoke French.

Once Jimmy was done, we headed to the train station, and after taking care of some errands we hopped on a train to Bern by way of Basel. 

We had another gorgeous train ride, but due to a filthy window we couldn’t get any pictures from the train. We arrived in Bern just as dusk was setting, and headed to our Airbnb.

Here’s a pic of the train station that I thought our nephews might like

After arriving at the flat, I got a message that our host was running late and wouldn’t be arriving for another 40 minutes. There weren’t any coffee shops nearby, so Jimmy and I just stood in front of the house in the cold with our luggage. It was a low point in the trip. 

At one point Jimmy noticed someone looking out of the window, but We just kept waiting. When the designated time came and went, I messaged her again. The door opened, and out popped a giant teenager who told us he was her son and could show us to our space. We wandered through the family home, waving at another giant teenager, and were lead to our private area with a private entrance. When he left, Jimmy cracked up about him knowing we were out there and not letting us in because “he’s a clueless teenager”. I think Jimmy was reminiscent of his own time as a teenager. 

Our Airbnb is pretty nice. Most of the space is in a self contained unit with our own private entrance (which man-child didn’t show us). His mom showed up and was lovely, and was able to show us around. One weird thing about the space, it mentioned the shower was separate from the bathroom, but didn’t mention you had to walk through the whole house to get to it. I have a feeling we’re going to be making some friends. 

At this point it was dark and we were tired, so we headed to a restaurant nearby for dinner. Here is a night time pic of Bern across the water

The plan is to see all that another time.

Here’s the cute restaurant

The menu was only in German, so Jimmy and I did some googling and tried to piece out the menu. I saw the word “spaghetti” in one description, and thought that sounded pretty safe. When it showed up, this is what it was:

Is that octopus, you may be asking. My answer: I have no idea but it seemed so. It was tentacley, and had little suction cups everywhere. The dish tasted pretty good, but the consistency of the tentacle was not my favorite. 

The neighborhood we’re staying in is full of cats, and they are all HUGE. Even bigger than our fat cats. And they are clearly pets because they are so friendly. Here’s a smaller one that made friends with me

And with that, it was time for bed. 

Good night.
