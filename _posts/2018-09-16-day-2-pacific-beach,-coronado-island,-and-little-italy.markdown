We woke up to another lovely day in San Diego. That’s actually going to become very redundant soon. All 10 days that we are spending in So Cal are supposed to be sunny and lovely. Jealous yet?

We decided to grab some breakfast in Ocean Beach before hitting our next beach neighborhood. I gave Jimmy the option between traditional heavy breakfast, or light fresh breakfast and he chose the latter. That led us to a cute little hippie style coffee shop called The Lazy Hummingbird. Their shop is adorable and earthy, and in addition to lots of different types of coffee and tea, they are famous for their Acai bowls. 

Acai bowls are everywhere here in San Diego. I remember seeing them every now and then in Maui, but here every corner stand has them. They are amazing. It’s like eating ice cream mixed with granola and fresh fruit for breakfast. Here’s mine:

Jimmy got a coffee, and I decided to go out on a limb and try a dandelion latte. Nothing wrong with trying new things, right? Wrong. So much wrong with dandelion lattes. It was described by the barista as “being just like coffee but with less acidity”. My assessment: Just like dirt mixed with dandelions. I know, because I’m pretty sure I ate that as a kid. 

Despite the bad experience with the latte, The Lazy Hummingbird was super cute, the acai bowls were awesome, so two thumbs still up. Definitely visit if you’re in OB.

After breakfast, we made a quick pit stop at a coffee shop and boutique I’d ducked inside yesterday. This shop doesn’t look like much on the outside, but it’s full of gems inside, including a dancing barista. Even Jimmy found a treasure to buy.

That was more than enough shopping for one day for Jimmy, so we hit the beach. 

Pacific Beach holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever went surfing. You know, right before I found out that I don’t actually like surfing. The Pacific Beach neighborhood is very laid back, just like OB, but with a little less hippie of a vibe. Due to it’s proximity to Mission Bay and Sea World, it’s also a pretty touristy beach. Most of the people around us were clearly tourists, and many of them from Europe. Pacific Beach has close breaking waves, which means that you can often stand up in between waves when surfing, so it’s a great beach for surfers who are learning or trying for the first time.

We did the necessary 20 minutes of driving around the area looking for a parking spot, then found one and hit the beach. Jimmy did some surfing and I read some Game of Thrones . . . I mean Tolstoy or something high and lofty.

Here’s Jimmy surfing:

Here’s me trying to take a selfie with Jimmy surfing in the background:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId19.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId19.jpg)

Yeah, that’s a fail. I think he’s the light colored blob in the background. Or maybe that’s just some dude swimming. Who knows.

As I was in the water trying to catch epic pics, I kept getting hit by kelp slapping my legs when the waves would come in. For some reason it made me think of jelly fish, which made me think of the time Jimmy’s friend, Brad, got stung by a jelly fish when visiting San Diego for our wedding. After a while, I just couldn’t hold it together anymore, so I headed back in to our blanket and got my sun tan on. When Jimmy got back I told him about my new found fear of jelly fish, and his response was “Oh, that’s funny. The guy at the surf shop warned me that there were jelly fish here so you have to watch out.” 

I think I still recommend surfing at PB, but watch out for jelly fish.

By that time we were both getting hungry, so we wandered down the neighborhood looking for lunch. I had heard of amazing tacos from a blog, so we headed to Mimi’s Taco Shop in search of amazing tacos, and let me tell you, amazing tacos were found! 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId20.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId20.jpg)

It’s a tiny shop with no indoor seating, but the tacos were awesome. We originally only ordered a couple of tacos because I had plans for ice cream, but we ended up ordering more a couple times. So good!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId21.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId21.jpg)

After tacos, we made our way to another part of the neighborhood for ice cream.

If you’ve read our blog before, you know that Jimmy’s sore and tired feet are the bane of our vacationing existence. He is always getting sore feet, or blisters, or any other number of foot related issues, which always slow us down. Walking in the flip flops we wore to the beach was taking it’s toll on both of us, but Jimmy had a solution: motorized scooters. 

Yep, motorized scooters that you can pick up anywhere, rent per mile, and just leave anywhere when you are done are a thing and are legit in San Diego. In Seattle we have the Lime bikes, which just seem like a nuisance because I rarely see people use them, and often see them left in random places (like the middle of nowhere in a neighborhood in unincorporated Bothell). The scooters as called “Birds” and tons of people are using them. Jimmy had been excited about them since he first saw them, and saw this as his golden opportunity to convince me to give them a try. And it worked.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId22.jpg)

I’m ashamed to say it, but I’m terrible at motorized scootering. Jimmy said I scooter like a granny. I was terrified of hitting pedestrians when on the sidewalk, and even more terrified of being hit by a car on the street. I persevered, and we made it to ice cream.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId23.jpg)

Btw, Jimmy is a scootering pro. Obviously. 

The ice cream shop was a place called Baked Bear that I had heard about from a friend. The make customized ice cream sandwiches. You choose the cookies and ice cream flavors, and they put it all together for you.

Jimmy and I both made excellent choices and loved our ice cream sandwiches.

After that, it was time to scooter back to our car and head back to our AirBnB to shower and get ready for dinner and visiting Coronado Island. 

For those who don’t know, Coronado Island is where Jimmy and I had our wedding ceremony. It’s an island connected to San Diego by a giant and very tall bridge. The island is famous as an upscale resort, and has a decadent and historic hotel called the Hotel Del Coronado. A lot of people spend a ton of money to get married at the hotel (including a lucky couple we saw today), but Jimmy and I got married on the public beach a half a mile down the beach from the hotel (we also saw a couple getting married near our public beach spot as well). 

Here’s the Hotel Del Coronado

We wandered down the beach in search of the spot where we exchanged our vows.

I’m going to be honest with you, it’s really hard to remember where the exact spot was, but we found a spot that seemed pretty close.

Ok, ok, enough romantic type pics. Let’s get back to the good stuff: Food!

When I lived in San Diego, I was a poor college student. I always wanted to go to Little Italy and eat at one of the super trendy restaurants, but my family’s motto is “it takes money to buy whisky”, and I didn’t have either of those in college. Tonight, Jimmy made my little Italy dream come true. 

We started out at a brewery, because they slowest pub crawl in history continues, then we headed to a park to watch the sunset over the harbor.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId42.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20180915/imagerId42.jpg) 

We also watched the planes land, because San Diego’s airport is right downtown, so when planes come in for landings they fly directly over most of the city. Here’s one plane right above my head.



For dinner we went to a place called Herb and Wood that I’d read about in a magazine. The food was awesome, and the building was really cool too.

The food was amazing.

We had planned to go to one of my old favorite spots for dessert after dinner, but the food was so good and they had a peach raspberry shortcake with lavender honey ice cream, so we made a night of it. They also brought us another dessert because when I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything and I wrote that we were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary. Because we are. No judgement.
