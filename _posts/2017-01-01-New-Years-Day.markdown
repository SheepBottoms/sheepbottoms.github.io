Happy New Year! We hope everyone had a safe and happy celebration, and has awoken as refreshed as we are.
Actually, we didn’t awake very refreshed. We slept in way too late, let hanger come on, then went scrounging for breakfast. Everything was closed because, you know, it’s a holiday. Luckily, we found the golden oasis that is . . . Starbucks! Yep, we went out in Edinburgh and found a little bit of home.

A couple cool things about Starbucks in Scotland:

1.	They have yummy syrups we don’t have in the States. I used to love Gingerbread lattes, but a few years ago they stopped selling them. Imagine my surprise when I go to a Starbucks in the UK and find a gingerbread latte. I am now feeling indignant that they have been robbing Americans of this joy.

2.	The food is way better. Like waaaaaaaaaaaay better. We got breakfast croissants with ham and cheese that didn’t look they’d been processed into dog food and left to sit for three weeks.

3.	The barista thought we were amazing because we were from Seattle. She got so excited and had a million questions about what it’s like in Seattle. 

Ok, enough about UK Starbucks, which just to summarize, is way better.
Since a lot of things were closed we decided to enjoy the decent weather we were getting and hike up Arthur’s Seat. Arthurs seat is an extinct volcano that overlooks Edinburgh. Here’s some of the views

Unfortunately, Jimmy’s shoes didn’t fit correctly and his feet started hurting. Not recognizing that he was in actual pain, I ditched him with my bag and hiked out to the endge of the cliff in this picture.

Totally worth it, but I do feel bad for ditching him. I returned to find him becoming increasingly grumpy, which is odd because I am generally the one to get grumpy, and I own it. Finally recognizing that he was having a terrible time, we decided to head back to the apartment and get some rest/do some laundry before dinner.
I had been excited about this dinner since I started planning the trip. It was at a restaurant called The Witchery, which was located in a 16th century building right outside Edinburgh castle. It was ornately decorated inside, and served amazing food. Jimmy and I agreed that it was the fanciest restaurant we had ever dined in, although it still cost less than a nice night out in Seattle.

After dinner we did the Cadies and Witchery Murder and Mystery tour, in which a real Edinburgh ghost took us through the streets of the old town and told us various ghost stories.

The tour was pretty fun, and the ghost had a side kick that made random appearances jumping out of buildings in various ghostly costumes. It also had a surprising amount of history involved, including how the restaurant The witchery got its name (spoiler: it was because they used to burn witches right outside the building).

After that it was back to bed. We’re getting up early to drive to Loch Ness and the Isle of Skye tomorrow. So excited!

Good night.
