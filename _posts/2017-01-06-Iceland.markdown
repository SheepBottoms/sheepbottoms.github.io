This morning we woke up in Iceland. Seriously. WE WOKE UP IN ICELAND!!!! 
I know. I can’t believe it either.

We wandered around and got breakfast at a place called the Grey Cat. I’m not even going to try to spell that in Iceland, because I am fully aware of my many limitations. Reykjavik is another beautiful place, but our main goal today was to go on a tour that took us Glacier hiking and out to hunt for the elusive Northern Lights. 

Before all of that, though, I solved my Icelandic Sweater problem. I found an Icelandic design company that makes sweaters that I actually find cute out of real Icelandic wool. It’s not the traditional style, but it is a real Iceland sweater. Problem solved.

Reykjavik is pretty cool, because the town paints it’s houses in bright colors.

We also spent some time wandering around the harbor area of Reykjavik.

Reykjavik has some pretty cool mural art too.

We hopped on a 15 person passenger van with a lovely guide who was wonderfully talkative and just a few years younger than us. She drove us out to a glacier, and talked about the constantly shifting terrain of Iceland due to its many volcanos. Iceland is called the land of fire and ice, and both rest near each other. She told us that geysir’s and hot springs will often pop in one place, only to move later when a volcano becomes active and causes a small earth quake.

We drove by the volcano that erupted in 2010 and left my sister stranded in Finland for a while, then headed up to our glacier.

The glacier was cool because it had a frozen lagoon at the base, and was surrounded with black volcanic rock. When you go to Iceland, it’s important to have a licensed guide take you to the glaciers, because they are always changing and moving. Our guide said that even though the lagoon looked frozen, the ice was very thin and it would be easy to fall through. She also pointed out some spots on the glacier that looked solid but we actually giant holes. She stated that in the summer she has heard stories of animals falling in a hole, and popping back up in the lagoon.
They fitted us with crampons and pick axes, and out we went.

The cool thing about glaciers in the winter, is that ice looks blue. Our guide said that the ice tends to look more white in the summer when the sun hits it, but in the winter with cloud cover it appears a beautiful blue color.

There were cravats all over the glacier, so it was nice to have our guide showing us the way.

By the time we headed down from the glacier, our daylight was waning. So we rocked the headlamps

After that we went to a nearby inn for dinner, then got to see a waterfall all lit up for the nighttime.

Then it was time to chase the Northern lights. I hate to disappoint everyone, but we didn’t see them. It was cloudy and rainy, and they just weren’t visible. Our guide felt terrible about it, but was able to come up with another plan. She stated that this particular day happened to be the last day of the Christmas season in Iceland. She stated that Christmas actually went for 13 days, and that Icelandic folklore had 13 santa clauses that visited over 13 days. She stated that children would leave a sock out each night, and if they were good they would get a small toy or candy, but if they were bad they would get a potato. 

Since most people celebrate the last day of Christmas with a bonfire and fireworks, she took us to the Skogafoss waterfall where the small community nearby was having an end of Christmas celebration. They had the biggest bonfire I’ve ever seen, and even threw some Christmas trees on the fire, then they lit up the waterfall by sending fireworks soaring over it. It wasn’t the Northern lights, but it was still pretty magical.

Then we headed back, and crawled into bed. Busy day tomorrow visiting the Blue Lagoon and flying home.

Good night.
