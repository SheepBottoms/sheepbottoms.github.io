Tsukji Fish market, a shrine, and the national sumo tournament.

Good morning everyone! Today we ate sashimi for brunch! My first time ever, and it was surprisingly good, although I am missing my avocado toast. 

Our plan for the day was to spend the morning at Tsukji fish market, where you can buy fresh caught fish of the day and wander market stalls trying other fun Japanese goodies, visit the Imperial Palace park in the early afternoon, spend the late afternoon and evening at the National Sumo Wrestling Tournament, and then head to our new hotel near Tokyo Disney Resort in preparation for our day of Disney magic tomorrow. 

The good news: We did all of that! 

The bad news: It wasn’t as smooth as it sounded on paper.

It started out great. We left our little AirBnB, which now that we are gone I can say was on the edge of the Ueno and Asakusa neighborhoods, a two minute walk from Ueno station and a 10 minute walk from Sensoji temple. It was a great area to stay, as Ueno park was so lovely, and the historic district of Asakusa had so many great food options. The downside to staying in that neighborhood was that the popular and busy areas of Shibuya and Shinjuku were pretty far away. Our time in Tokyo was so limited that we didn’t get the opportunity to spend very much time in those districts, so we’ll have to come back.

Ueno station is huge, so we dropped our bags off at some lockers next to a giant panda statue thinking we’d definitely be able to find that later, then headed off to Tsukji. We knew were planning to eat a late breakfast at the market, as we wouldn’t be eating lunch until around 3pm at the sumo tournament, so we immediately started food hunting. 

This was my choice:

They were advertising pineapple pancakes! Jimmy disagreed with that option and we kept going.

Before getting to the market, we passed an important Buddhist temple, and visited inside. There was a service going on, and the monks were singing. It was beautiful.

The temple and grounds were lovely, but we were hungry so we kept moving. As we neared the market, we were joined by tons of tourists and people handing out flyers for their little shops and restaurants inside the market. On the outside of the market was the modern city with all of these skyscrapers. [![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId11.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId11.jpg)

Inside the market was this:

Most of the market was just tarps or cloth awnings over small stalls. After the rain of yesterday, it was great to have sunny 80 degree weather today. The market was so crowded it was difficult to walk through, and we noticed tourists and locals all out enjoying the stalls.

If you followed us forever ago when we traveled to Greece, you may remember I started a rule there to never eat the tiny fish. I held onto that rule here, but I did try tiny candied crabs. There were strange, and I still haven’t decided if it was in a good way or not. 

Fish pastries filled with . . . fish!

Oh my goodness, I fished in my wallet for money for one of these, but I didn’t have enough coins. Sorry Mongo and Tugger!

More fish

Peach juice! I got you on that one. You thought it was going to be more fish

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId23.jpg)

It is!

After a while we were getting really hungry. All of the little restaurants looked the same, and we were having a hard time figuring out which one we should go into.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId25.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId25.jpg)

Sake bar

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId26.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId26.jpg)

We eventually ducked into one that had sumo on in the background. We were hoping it was a good sign that we were the only white people and no one spoke English. Food was great, and came with this little crustacean.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId29.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId29.jpg)

After that we hit the streets, looking for a shrine with semi-famous lion statues. On the way we found some great coffee and this mural.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId30.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId30.jpg)

The little shrine was a very peaceful spot in a busy city.

And the lion heads were pretty cool.

Tourists mixed with worshipers. By the way, if you see people in pictures wearing shorts, they are almost tourists. We saw very few Japanese people in shorts, and in general people in Japan dress up a lot more than people on the west coast of the US. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId35.jpg)

We wandered towards a park, and found these little cat prints. So cute!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId36.jpg)

It’s eating a dumpling!

Finding a park in the city

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId39.jpg)

The park had a duck pond and tea house in it I wanted to go to, but it cost money to enter, and Jimmy was feeling lame. We decided to head to the Imperial Palace park instead so we would have time to explore there before going to the sumo tournament.

Some sights along the way.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId41.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId41.jpg)

At some point we ended up on a series of roof terraces trying to figure out how to get to the metro. One of the buildings had this giant clock.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId42.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId42.jpg)

After much wandering on the tops of buildings, then many stairs down, we found the metro and made it to the Imperial Palace.

Looking for the garden entrance we saw an art class working on sketching in the sunshine.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId45.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId45.jpg)

The giant castle wall still has a legitimate moat around it.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId48.jpg)

And a lovely walkway.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId49.jpg)

When we got to the garden entrance there was assign saying the garden was closed on Mondays. Today is a Monday. Planning fail. On the list for our next visit to Japan. We decided just to head to the sumo tournament a bit early.

The tournament was going all day, from the morning to late into the evening. We were planning to be there from about 2:30 to 6pm, which seemed like an awful lot of sumo watching to me. Jimmy was super excited about it, though, so since the trip is light on museums (his usual favorite attraction) I decided a large chunk of the day for sumo would be worth it for him.

Outside the stadium was decorated with banners.

Inside the stadium.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId52.jpg)

It was a huge arena, and our tickets came with a bento box lunch. The area in the picture above is where we got our lunch. I was surprised that they were stored in refrigerators, but figured they knew what they were doing. We found our seats and started enjoying sumo magic.

When we got there the stadium was pretty empty, and it was the less experienced wrestlers competing. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId53.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId53.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId54.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId54.jpg)

Each round they introduced the new competitors with a ceremony.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId55.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId55.jpg)

There was also a ceremony for beginning each match, and a ceremony for ending each match, and a ceremony for during the match. Basically, 90% of a sumo match is ceremony, and 2 seconds is actual wrestling. Jimmy loved it, and got some great pictures and videos. I loved it for about 20 minutes, then I honestly got a little bored. I feel like a terrible person for saying that because it was such an amazing experience to be there, but it’s a little true. The matches did more exciting as the more experienced wrestlers started going and the crowd got bigger.

Let’s take a short break from Sumo to talk about toilets in Japan. They are intense in one of two ways: if they are western style toilets, they came equipped with all sorts of bells and whistles, a  build in bidet, often heated seating, and tons of other buttons (labeled in Japanese) that I don’t know what to do with. If it’s a Japanese style toilet, it is a hole in the ground that you squat over and then flush like a regular toilet. Up until the sump tournament, I had only ever seen the western style toilets. The women’s bathroom at the stadium had a line (because no matter where you go in the world the women’s bathroom will have a line), and when my turn came I opened the door to find a Japanese style toilet. I figured all toilets in the stadium were that style, so I went for it. When I got back to my seat I chastised Jimmy for not telling me they were Japanese style toilets, as he had used the bathroom earlier. Jimmy looksed surprised and  said, “Mine wasn’t that way. It had a heated seat. It was really nice.” I stared at him incredulously as it sunk in that they must have both styles and I just got unlucky. I squatted over a hole in the ground, and Jimmy got a heated seat.

We ate our bento boxes, which were ok, but about an hour after eating mine I started to feel queasy. I’m not sure if it was the box, walking around in the heat all afternoon, or exhaustion, but I steadily went downhill. Jimmy was having so much fun that I held it together until about 6pm, then I was toast. We also needed to head to our next hotel near Tokyo Disney, and find some dinner. 

We made it back Ueno station, but exited at a different area in the station than we had been in before, and there was no giant panda statue to be seen. Luckily, if you stand looking confused for long enough in Tokyo, some kind soul will help you out. We told him our bags were with a giant panda, and without batting an eye he knew exactly what we meant and showed us the way. 

By this point it was 7:40pm, and we thought we would be late enough to miss rush hour. We were wrong. This is a little hint of what rush hour looks like above ground.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId56.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/15/imagerId56.jpg)

On the metro, we were packed into the train with everyone staying standing by leaning on each other . . . with our luggage. We travel light, only taking carry on bags, but it was kind of a nightmare. Apparently rush hour is later in Japan.

We made it our hotel, and wandered down the street to a convenience store. Cold Udon noodles for dinner at 9:30pm could have been worse, and we found these little ice cream packets that sucked our (mostly my) grouchiness away. Now it’s bedtime, since our day starts at 6am tomorrow to beat the crowds to Disney. I’ve heard that Tokyo Disney is the busiest Disney resort in the world, but I’ve got a game plan so hopefully all will go well.

Goodnight!
