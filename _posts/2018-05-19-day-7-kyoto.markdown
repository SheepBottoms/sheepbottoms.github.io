Hello all! Today was our first full, official day in Kyoto. Poor Jimmy woke up very sick today. I roused him awake around 7am, but he quickly fell asleep again, so I decided to ditch him for the morning and do some exploring on my own. I told him to text me when he was ready to meet up for lunch. I didn’t hear from him again until 1:30pm. More on that later.

On the upside, I’m not feeling sick. I woke up ready to hit the streets for some shopping, tea, shrines, and a whatever else I stumbled upon while exploring. The downside was that Jimmy being out of commission messed with my intricate plan that would allow us to see EVERYTHING in Kyoto in 3 days. I didn’t want to see any really major sites without him, and I didn’t want to go too far away in case he wanted to meet up, so our plan became way more chill. 

On the downside, my foot continued to be swollen. It still wasn’t too bad, so I decided to ride out the day and see what happened. 

I started my day by wandering through the tiny streets of downtown Kyoto. Here’s the area by our AirBnb:

Lots of the little shops were just starting to open, and were putting all their decorative flowers out.

Kyoto is a fun city. Later, when Jimmy emerged from his Nyquil stuper, he commented that Kyoto reminded him of Rome. Everywhere you look in Rome there are beautiful little churches with amazing artwork inside. In Kyoto, everywhere you turn are lovely shrines and temples. Some of them are small like a shrine that is next door to our AirBnB (which I’m now realizing I never got a picture of. . . maybe there’s one later on as I comb through pictures), some of them quite large like this one just down the street:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId7.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId7.jpg)

I also noticed that Kyoto has tiny streets, and lots of wires. Why so many wires?

I made my way to a famous market area in Kyoto called Nishiki market. It’s a covered market that sells fresh goods like fruits, veggies, and (can you guess?) fish!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId8.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId8.jpg)

It was still a bit early, so the fresh food sellers were out, but as you continue to wander through the market there are a lot of shops that sell souvenirs and restaurants that were not yet open, so it was kind of quiet.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId12.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId12.jpg)

At one end of the market was a medium sized shrine:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId14.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId14.jpg)

Yes, that is a full grown adult with a teddy bear strapped to her backpack. More common sight than you’d think.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId15.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId15.jpg)

At shrines they often have a machine with the likeness of the diety the shrine is dedicated to which you can put money in and get a fortune. If your fortune is bad, you can leave it here.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId18.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId18.jpg)

These are wooden cards that people write hopes, dreams, and wishes on. This one reminded me of Byron.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId20.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId20.jpg)

I ended up getting an oracle from the machine. Mine was good, so I decided to hang on to it.

Me in the shrine

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId22.jpg)

All by my onsie. 

I also found this: a Bengal cat and owl café . . . hopefully two different cafes as I imagine one of those creatures would eat the others. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId23.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId24.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId24.jpg)

It didn’t open until 11 (and it was like 9:30am), so I didn’t get to go inside, but I was excited to at least see a cat café in Japan. I’d heard so much about them.

I continued to wander, heading towards a tea shop I’d heard about from Lonely Planet and blogs. On the way I found this shop selling beautiful Japanese artwork:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId25.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId25.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId26.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId26.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId27.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId27.jpg)

These cute little alleys

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId28.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId28.jpg)

And a hedgehog café.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId29.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId29.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId30.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId30.jpg)

Which was also closed. Apparently the animal cafes have become so popular, that people are constantly looking to find more exotic animals to put in their shops, which has raised a lot of concern from animal rights activists who believe it’s abusive. I didn’t have to wrestle with that moral conundrum because it was closed. They sure look pretty cute, though.

This is a little square just outside the shopping arcade.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId31.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId31.jpg)

At that point I continued my wandering, an stumbled upon a Buddhist temple. Worshipers were singing and ringing bells, and there was a sign welcoming visitors, so I stopped and listened for a moment. It was a great excuse to rest my foot.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId32.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId33.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId33.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId34.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId34.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId35.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId35.jpg)

At this point, I did what I do best and proceeded to get very lost. I ended up back in the shopping arcade, wandering around in circles for a while, trying to find my way to my next shopping destination. I found this amazing sock shop.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId36.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId36.jpg)

I haven’t asked anyone local about it, but socks seem to be a big deal in Japanese culture. They take their shoes off a lot to enter buildings, and I noticed most people had socks that were way more exciting than my simple black ones. 

I also stumbled upon this place:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId37.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId37.jpg)

It is impossible to adequately understand this place in pictures. It was a two story store full of claw machines and photo booth boxes. It had hundreds of machines, and each machine was blaring different carnival style music. It had bright lights and SO MUCH COLOR.

Here’s some of the games:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId38.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId38.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId39.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId40.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId40.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId41.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId41.jpg)

I walked in, entranced by all the stimulation, and stood staring for long enough that an employee came up to me and asked if I was ok. At which point I felt obligated to blow 3,000 yen trying to win a stuffed hedgehog. My dad and sister are so good at those claw games. They would have been disappointed in me.

Perhaps the most fascinating part of the store was a little section that was roped off and had a sign stating you could not venture past that point without being a woman, or having a woman in tow. I tried to get a pic of the sign (because the translation into English was amazing . . . because it made zero sense), but I think I was so excited by the space that it came out blurry. On the other side of the rope was a full on glam station with costumes, make kits, and hair accessories, and a bunch of photo booths.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId42.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId42.jpg)

Guys, the temptation to spend my morning glamming myself up into Sailor Moon getting photos with enlarged eyes was SO STRONG. But I resisted. I saw a bunch of girls who looked about 13 wander in, and decided a lone woman in her 30’s hanging with them was weird. Besides, I was still looking for the tea shop. I moved on.

The tea shop was a few blocks outside of the arcade, and was on an adorable street.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId44.jpg)

I’m noticing in these pictures that the weather looks overcast (which it was) which would imply to the average US Northwesterner that it was mild or cool. It was not. It was over 80 degrees and so humid. I felt wet the entire day. Local women dressed in their adorable skirts, culottes, and long sleeved tops and cardigans looking like they were a bit chilly. How do they do that?!? Anyway, the point is, they all looked amazing, and I spent the day looking like a rat that had drowned in it’s own sweat. Not the point. Back to the teahouse. 

It was super cute.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId45.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId45.jpg)

This is the front of the teashop, and now that I’m looking at this pic I notice the creepy face in the window. Totally didn’t notice it when I was there.

In Japan, green tea is where it’s at. Matcha is traditional for tea ceremonies, but there are other types that are popular as well. Your tea experience always comes with a little Japanese treat. This teahouse served one soft sweet, and one hard sweet, and the soft one was dyed purple and folded into a shape that was supposed to represent an iris.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId46.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId46.jpg)

The teahouse we went to in Tokyo was not a traditional teahouse, so I walked in here feeling like I had no idea what to do. I was also the only white person sitting down for tea. Thankfully, they saw me coming a mile away and gave me a server who spoke very good English and patiently explained everything to me. I had some choice on what kind of tea to try, so I tried the traditional matcha, and I tried some other kind of green tea. Both were great, but very earthy in flavor. It’s very different from the dark teas in England that are usually sweetened with sugar, floral flavors, or spices.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId47.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId47.jpg)

Matcha

Tea #2 was fun because it came loose-leaf and my server walked me through the process of making it in a traditional tea pot.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId48.jpg)

Afterwards, I dropped into the connecting tea shop where I bought a bunch of tea from a French guy. I still hadn’t heard form Jimmy, so I continued to explore the little shops around, deciding that I would make my way to the Imperial Palace where it would be easy for Jimmy to find me.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId49.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId50.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId50.jpg)

The Imperial Palace is surrounded by a large green area called the Imperial Palace Park. Google maps didn’t actually tell me where the entrance to the palace was, so I ended up wandering through most of the park for about an hour looking for the entrance. Luckily, I was joined halfway through by a Chinese couple who were very sweet and also wandered the entire complex looking for the entrance. 

I texted Jimmy to see if he wanted to meet up before I went in, but I didn’t hear from him and it was free to enter, so I wandered in on my own.

The Imperial Park

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId51.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId51.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId52.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId52.jpg)

The Imperial Palace was another reminder of how easy it is to be a tourist in Japan, because everything is so darned organized. There was a clearly marked route to follow at the Imperial Palace, and I was given a pamphlet in English that talked about everything. I love Europe, but monuments there tend to be a free for all and you lose time trying to figure out what it is you’re looking at. This hasn’t happened in Japan.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId53.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId53.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId56.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId56.jpg)

I’m not going to lie, the Imperial Palace in Kyoto was a bit of a letdown. You couldn’t go inside, and the grounds around just weren’t that exciting compared to other gardens we’d seen in Japan. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId57.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId58.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId58.jpg)

I mean, looking back at the pics it was kind of pretty.

It’s possible that I was just bitter and frustrated that all of the shaded areas were roped off, and I was feeling at the peak of being a hot, sweat-drenched, drowned rat. Luckily, Jimmy chose that moment to text me back and announce that he was up and ready, and on his way to meet me.

I excited the Palace area, and sat outside a café to wait for him, setting my shopping bag with like $70 worth of tea in it next to me. When we travel, my job is to plan everything, and Jimmy’s job is to keep us from getting too lost and make sure I don’t leave anything sitting on the ground, floor, or a bench when I leave places. I decided to meet Jimmy at the metro station so we could go to a new area of town for lunch, and left my bag sitting on the ground.

I had heard that Japan was really safe. Lonely planet stated it was so safe that you could leave your purse on a bench and come back 30 minutes later to find it still sitting where you left it. I gave myself the opportunity to test that theory. I walked 15 minutes to meet Jimmy, realized I had forgotten my bag, and rushed back to see if I could find it. The whole way back I was beating myself up that I was so forgetful and going to dark places of being unlovable in my head, but when I got back to the chair I had been sitting in, my bag was still there. I grabbed it and decided to give myself a break, and that Japan was amazing. 

We decided to take a cab to the restaurant because we thought it would be faster than walking back to the metro, but we got stuck in horrible traffic. Come to find out there was a procession of people on the bridge carrying a shrine. #Kyotoproblems. 

We made to this amazing place for lunch. Say hi to Jimmy.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId67.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId67.jpg)

And to my amazing hibiscus fruit juice. It was delightful

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId68.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId68.jpg)

This restaurant was small and does a set lunch because they use all fresh ingredients they get from the market that day. Jimmy went with soup.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId69.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId69.jpg)

Looks pretty good, right? 

This is what I got:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId70.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId70.jpg)I don’t even remember half of what was on that plate, but it was all amazing. I do know that I’ve some Zucchini with ratatouille, and some tempura veggies with some kind of sweet sauce. THE BEST.

The restaurant was awful cute too.

 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId71.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId71.jpg)

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId72.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId72.jpg)

I took a pic of the sign because if we come back to Kyoto, we are definitely coming back here.

After lunch, we made our way to the Philosopher’s Path, which is a walkway that goes along a pretty canal between two major temples. 

Here’s part of the philosopher’s path:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId73.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId73.jpg)

Here’s the walkway up to temple #1 Ginkakuji, or the silver pavilion. You leave the serene philosopher’s path, and head up a tiny street lined with people and shops. The guidebooks had told me to go first thing in the morning to avoid crowds, but when you’ve got someone who’s sick you do what you can. It was fun to see the energy of the street.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId74.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId74.jpg)

Here’s the entrance to the pavilion. You’ll notice in the picture that Kyoto is full of two things: tourists and school kids who are on field trips.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId75.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/2018/05/19/imagerId75.jpg)

The school kids were pretty fun. They were generally given little booklets to fill out, and part of their booklets seemed to always involve a section where they were supposed to follow a script engaging people in speaking English. We got stopped by a few packs of giggling kids, and we noticed white people seemed to be their main target audience. I wandered if these kids ever run into white people who don’t speak English. 

One pack of three girls asked me to name someone famous from my country. After thinking for a moment I names Beyoncé. There eyes lit of and they seemed extcited about her, then asked me if I know who Ariana Grande is, and if I like her. I didn’t want to disappoint them, so I told them I did know who she was and loved her music (true, not true). They went on to call my bluff by wanting to know my favorite Ariana Grande song so they could write it in their book. I wanted to say “alright, you caught me. I can’t name any of her songs”, but Jimmy came through and asked their favorite song. One of the girls quickly answered, and we enthusiastically agreed that the song they named was AMAZING, even though neither of us had ever heard it. I just didn’t want to disappoint them.

After wandering the pavilion on our organized, predetermined route, we headed back down the street to the Philosopher’s Path.

I ended up finding a grumpy temple cat

And Jimmy took a break on a scenic bench

At the end of the walk we ran into a man who was hanging out on a small bridge making bamboo boats. He was very excited to talk to us in English, and forced us into picture taking.

He had each of us drop the boats into the canal while making a wish

We then wandered through part of town to find temple #2 Eikando

I found this cool restaurant with these fun statues

We got to the beautiful temple just in time for it to close.

We wandered the outside a bit, then moved on.

There was no metro within walking distance, so we hopped in a cab. We were about halfway back to our BnB, when we realized that we were running low on cash. Japan is a very cash based society, and a lot of places including taxis don’t accept cards, particularly foreign cards. There was a brief moment of freak out in the back of the cab when we realized we didn’t have enough cash for the full cab faire home, but a quickly google maps search told us we were steps away from a metro, and thank goodness, 7eleven with an ATM. We hopped out of our cab just as the meter was hitting our limit, and made our way home on the metro.

We headed back out to  a ramen and dumpling place for dinner. It was very good, and also very full of tourists like us.

Jimmy was feeling good after dinner, and we had both been wanting to learn more sake, so we went to a small local bar with an owner that we heard loved to teach people about sake. Here’s some views from the walk there.

The bar was tiny, only enough room for about 6 people, and we were lucky to be the last two people to get seats. A group after us was turned away.

The owner told us about how sake is made and what gives it different flavors, and he chose a tasting set of 6 different sakes for us to try. It was fun.

After sake tasting it was time for home and bed.

Good night.
