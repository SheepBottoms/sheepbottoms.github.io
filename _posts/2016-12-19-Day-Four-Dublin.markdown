Today was the day that Jimmy basically humored all my whims, and made my wildest Dublin dream come true. 
To start, we’ve checked out of our Dublin lodging by now, so let me tell you a bit about our home in Dublin. It was an AirBnB that was in the incredible Temple Bar neighborhood, and was very cozy inside. That being said, it had a couple quirks. On the outside it looked like a cross between an old third class cruise ship, and a prison. Also, we were told that there was another couple staying in the other room, but we kind of assumed they never made it because we didn’t see them at all. Until today. When we saw the guy in the kitchen. In his boxers. Awkward.

Quirks aside, it was an awesome place and I would 100% recommend it for anyone coming to Dublin. We could walk everywhere within minutes.
This BnB was also amazing because it was basically next door to the most amazing place on earth. It’s called Queen of Tarts, and they do incredible baked goods, breakfasts, lunches, and desserts.

Seriously, check out this homemade scone and preserves.

It was so cute inside and, they were nice enough to take a picture of us with our spread.

Here’s a little look down Cows Lane, which is where Queen of Tarts is and was just out our front door.

Since I visited art museums with Jimmy the day before, he agreed to visit the Dublin writer’s museum with me. To get there we wandered over the lovely Ha’Penny bridge and through O’Connell street.

The general post office was in the center of the Easter Uprising, and you can still bullet holes all over the columns.

On the way out we also dropped by Arnott’s department store, where they had a mix’n’match hot cocoa bar. I will always say “yes” to that. They also had a market going on outside the department store, which was incredibly busy with Christmas shoppers.

Last time we came to Dublin I was really hoping to make it the writer’s museum, because British lit was my favorite in college and most of the writers I liked the best were Irish (Swift, Yeats, Beckett, and of course THE MAN George Bernard Shaw). We didn’t make it last time due to lack of time, so I was pretty excited.
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic16.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic16.jpg)

Just to be straight up, for most people this museum is boring. It’s a lot of old manuscripts under glass display cases, type writers of famous (and not so famous) Irish writers, and some art and photographs. Jimmy’s attempted supportive response was “it was fine.” Also, I had no idea James Joyce wrote about cats.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic17.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic17.jpg)

After the museum we went to lunch at a restaurant called The Church. It actually used to be a church, but now it serves food. The stained glass windows were lovely, and upstairs there was a pipe organ.

After lunch Jimmy promised me that he would take me to, what was for him, a most dreaded tourist attraction: The leprechaun museum. I knew it was cheesy and totally for children, but I love that kind of thing so I was still excited to go. When we got to the ticket counter the tour was sold out until 5pm. The man at the counter stated, “Do you know what the tour is?” I said, “Where we learn about leprechauns?” He stated, “No, it’s horrid really. All the people are really obnoxious and it’s borderline racist.” Then he started laughing. “No, actually I’m the owner. I’m just buying time till I can find the next available time.” He bantered with us some more, and gave us a discount for “putting up with my antics.” 
With time to kill before that we went back across the river Liffey and decided to check out Christ Church Cathedral. It was a beautiful church, and I put a ton of pictures of it later in the post, but first I HAVE to talk about Dublina. If you visit Christ Church, you have the option to buy a combo ticket for an attraction that is connected to the church. Why is this particular attraction connected to the church? I have no idea. It’s like they decided that the church was way too big, and the only answer for it was to use one end of the church to create a Viking museum. Yep, Dublina is museum about Vikings in Ireland. Weird, you say? Yes, yes it was. It was complete with interactive sets, and mannequins dressed up in Viking clothing and acting out Viking scenes. At times it was amazing, at times it was super creepy. At one point we walked through a small black room with sounds of monsters and screaming in it. I’m pretty sure it was supposed to be Viking hell, but it wasn’t really explained.  
Here’s Jimmy attempted to draw some Viking runes.

And me getting myself into some trouble. I think I was probably a witch with my new-fangled modern days clothes. Or maybe I didn’t submit to my husband enough . . . not really sure.
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic23.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic23.jpg)

I had to include this box, because it asked me to put my hand in it and guess what was inside. Are you kidding me? After all the other weird things you’ve pulled in this museum?
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic24.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic24.jpg)

The was the exhibit about the black plague. “Bring out your dead!” Anyone?
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic25.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic25.jpg)

Easily the best part of the exhibit (from Jimmy’s perspective as well as mine) was this gentleman sitting on a Viking toilet. Why was this included? No Idea. I absolutely should have taken video, because there were sound effects. I think the Vikings didn’t get enough fiber in their diet.

Mel Huffaker, this pic is just for you. You told me to find a stray kitty to cuddle while I’m away missing my own kitties. Well, this is the closest thing I’ve seen.

At the end of Dublina we got to climb to the top of one of the church towers, where we got this lovely view of Dublin.
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic28.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic28.jpg)

The verdict? When in Dublin, Dublina is an absolute MUST.
From Dublin you go through an archway and can enter Christ Church. It was obviously beautiful.

My favorite part about it was that they had a game going on to help children learn about advent. They hid sheep near parts of the church that had significance to the advent season, and the children followed a guided scavenger hunt to find all the sheep. Here’s a few that I found.

You could also visit the crypt, which we did because, you know, there’s no way it could worse than Viking hell. 
It wasn’t. It basically housed all the treasure the church has received from royalty, and costumes from the BBC show The Tudors, which was apparently filmed in the church. The crypt also housed the church gift shop, which was called The Foxy Friar of all things. The older gentleman running the shop was certainly foxy, as he told me Ireland would be losing a true jewel when I returned home. 
Here are some of my favorite pictures of the outside of Christ Church.

After that we dashed over to Dublin castle, which used to be castle, but is no longer a castle, but they decided to keep the name despite the fact that it’s a boring government building. They took us on a tour to see “original Dublin castle walls” (A pile of stones underground) and the “water that run around the original castle moat” (water that wasn’t even deep enough to dip you toes in, and which the tour guide had stated had just been cleaned. Huh?). Here’s a couple pics.

That spire that looks like it should be interesting, is actually a records room. Fun.
We did get to see a lovely little chapel.  
When we ended that, we dashed back across the river Liffey, which was starting to look rather pretty in the twilight.

Then we got to see O’Connell street all lit up.

And on the leprechaun museum. It was awesome! It was all about Irish folklore and storytelling, told by a young woman with the most incredible Irish accent. Jimmy and I got to sit on a giant chair like a leprechaun, run through a rainbow to chase a pot of gold, and sit in a forest gazing into a wishing well. All in a building which was right below a gym. Definitely recommend this one for families, but we had a good time too.

Also, I found a sheep hat!

We ended our evening with dinner at a pub called the Hairy Lemon and Irish folk music at the Brazenhead, which claims to be Ireland’s oldest pub.

 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic56.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161219/pic56.jpg)
 
 Then off to bed, so we can get ready to go on the move to a new city tomorrow. Goodnight.

This is a special treat to you for making it all the way to the end. Congrats!
