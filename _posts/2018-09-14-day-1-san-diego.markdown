Ahhh, San Diego. My freshmen year of college I was incredibly fortunate to get to attend Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. Since then, San Diego has always had a special place in my heart. When I met Jimmy, I brought him here on our first vacation as a couple, and we both loved it so much that we had our wedding here. 

But life gets busy, and we haven’t been able back since the wedding. Until today! Today we came back for a 10th anniversary adventure, and I couldn’t be more excited. San Diego is fun in a way that it different than so many of our other traveling adventures, because it feels like home to me. I get to visit my old favorite places (a surprising number are still here) and enjoy finding new spots to love. But everything is familiar. 

Today we started out with a very wet and rainy day in Seattle. Here’s the view from the plan as we were taking off

Here’s the view as we landed in San Diego

In about 2.5 hours we went from 59 degrees and raining like crazy, to 80 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. It was glorious.

We decided to spend our first day in the area of San Diego that I am most familiar with, because it was where I spent most of my time when I lived here: Point Loma and Ocean Beach.

We landed around 12:30, picked up our rental car, and headed straight to one my favorite spots for fresh seafood with no frills: Point Loma Seafood. We got sushi, we got beer battered cod, we got shrimp, and we got crab. It was lovely.

Point Loma Seafood also sells fresh fish caught each morning, and the outdoor seating over looks the harbor. It’s a great reintroduction to the beautiful city.

After lunch it felt like time to hit the beach, so we made our way to the Ocean Beach pier and wandered down the pier. One of my favorite things about the neighborhood of Ocean Beach is that it is incredibly relaxed and colorful. So many of buildings have cool murals.

Here’s one on a preschool

Eventually we made it to the pier

This fishing pier is one of the most photographed spots in San Diego, and halfway down it has a cute little restaurant and shop. Here’s some views from the pier

After wandering the pier, we found a great place to lounge on the beach, do some swimming, and watch some surfer. We even got to watch the lifeguards get their jetski stuck on the beach. It was fun, and I was so relaxed I almost fell asleep.

We also watched a pigeon dive into the chip bag some people who had left their chips on their blanket while playing in the water> Memo to self, don’t leave open chip bags unattended on the beach. Pigeons will enter the bag.

Eventually, we decided to go wander around OB and look for some food. Goodbye beach!

We wandered up to Hodads, which is famous for giant burgers. They were giant, and the onion rings were awesome.

After Hodads we went looking for some great breweries. Like Seattle, San Diego has been making a name for their microbrewery culture. I knew there were a few in OB, so I wanted to check some out and knew it would be something Jimmy would enjoy. We first stumbled upon The Helm, which was really low and dog friendly.

We got a tasting flight, and by the time we were done, it was getting close to sunset. Watching the sunset on sunset cliffs was something I did all of the time when I was in San Diego, because you could walk from Point Loma campus. We parked and found a great spot to watch the sun set over the Ocean.

Once the sun was down, we decided to try out a brewery pub crawl that had been recommended to us by the bartender at the first brewery. There was about 4 on her list that were within walking distance, so we headed off to the next one which was called the Belching Beaver.

We had a great time at the Belching Beaver, but we also started getting tired, so we ditched the brewery crawl and grabbed some Macaroons and Cannoli from a nearby bakery. They were amazing, and the bakery happened to be next door to open air pub that had an incredibly talented musician playing. We sat at tables outside the pub, ate our dessert, and enjoyed the music. Then we headed to bed. Because we’re old. Brewery crawl complete. 

Good night.
