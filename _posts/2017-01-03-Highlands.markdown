Today was one of the days that I have been planning, dreaming, and thinking about since I began planning our trip. We drove way out of our way in order to reach the Isle of Skye. Skye is also called the misty isle, because the weather there is usually bad, so the clouds come down and make the island look like it is shrouded in mist. Locals told us that every now and then they will have a beautiful sunny day, but our day there was not like that.

Over a year ago Jimmy and I were planning a Europe trip for October, but due to a change in job and Jimmy having less time off, it made more sense for us to go over the holiday season, when we both already have built in days off. I was really hesitant about the plan, and I remember telling Jimmy that if we were going to do this trip in January, he better gear up because we are hiking the fairy pools on the Isle of Skye even if it’s pouring rain. Enter today:

Yep, at the fairy pools in pouring rain.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. We had an amazing breakfast at Cuillin Hills, which may be my favorite place on earth, The beds are so comfy! Everything there is perfect. My only complaint is that across the UK they have “bacon” on their breakfast menus. But it’s not actually bacon, it’s just ham. This has disappointed me every morning. Somehow I always forget, then it shows up and I’m like “oh yeah, this is not actually bacon.” Until this moring. They brought my food, and on my plate was real, honest goodness bacon. It’s a miracle. 

Today was a road trip with two hikes on the Isle of Skye: One was a hike in the Trotternish Peninsula, the other was to Glen Brittle in the Cuillin Hills. 

We left pretty early, but were able to get some pictures of Portree as the sun was rising. Here’s the views from Cuillin Hills hotel:

And here’s the outside of the hotel.

In the distance there you can see Portree and the harbor.

And here’s some better views of beautiful Portree

From there, we headed North to the Trotternish Peninsula. Sheep on a ravine. SO cute

Also, Highland cattle. SO furry

Notice the baby?

The first hike was up to see the Old Man of Storr, which is just some interesting rock formations. Rick Steve’s said that you can see the formations from the road, but we couldn’t. We decided to hike a little ways and see if we could get a glimpse of them.

We saw some incredibly scenery

But we did not make it to Old Man. It got really windy, and we decided that rather than spend time there we wanted to focus on heading to the viewpoint at Kilt Rock and making it the Fairy Pools.

As we drove to Kilt Rock we encountered some pedestrians on the road.

They were not happy we were taking over their road.

Fun fact: Sheep around Ireland and Scotland have their bottoms spray painted certain colors to let farmers know which sheep are theirs, because many farmers share grazing space. That’s why these sheep have orange bottoms.

We eventually made it to Kilt Rock. It was amazing.

To get this picture I had to hang halfway over the guardrail. Jimmy’s response “I can’t believe you do that.” SO pretty, though!

We then had to retrace our steps to get to the fairy pools, but we found another cool overlook and short hiking trail along the way.

Jimmy’s caption to this picture: Paige in her natural habitat. Walking right up to a cliff ledge to take a picture.
I’m always safe, though. I haven’t fallen . . . yet.

The clouds were rolling in, so it was time to move on.

We continued towards Glen Brittle. I mean, just look at this! Even in the winter with horrible weather it is still incredible.

As soon as we got the fairy pools, the rain started pouring. 

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20170103/image39.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20170103/image39.jpeg)


But a promise is a promise, so we soldiered on.

The first pool. The fairy pools are these little pools created by waterfalls in a river. The pools are a beautiful turquois color.

It was so wet at the pools, that I had to break out my waterproof pants for the first time on the trip. Cuteness factor: -8. Waterproofness: Amazing.

I must climb down steep and slippery rocks to get an amazing self with the fairy pools? Don’t mind if I do

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20170103/image50.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20170103/image50.jpeg)


And I convinced Jimmy to come down too.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20170103/image51.jpeg)]({{ site.images }}/20170103/image51.jpeg)


It just keeps getting more beautiful

After a while the trail got really muddy and we had to jump through streams, but we pressed forward.
Jimmy had his eyes set on the misty mountain in front of us.

We made it close enough to take a picture that was sufficiently epic for Jimmy. Then we realized that we were soaked and tired, and headed back to car for a long drive to Fort William, our base for the night.

On the way, we couldn’t resist on last stop at the Eilean Donan castle. This castle is known as one of the most beautiful in Scotland, and lots of movies have been filmed here. It is closed to visitors for the winter, but the gate to grounds was open so we let ourselves in.

And we broke out the tripod again for the obligatory couples pic.

Didn’t quite make the timer on that one.
I had this great idea for a romantic picture, but it didn’t quite work out.

Jimmy said that he likes it, but I think my long underwear that I’m wearing under my pants looks like giant fat rolls. Honest opinions are appreciated. 
After that we made our way to Fort William, and enjoyed another lovely BnB. More on that later. For now
Good night.
