Today we woke up in the most comfortable bed ever. I felt great! Jimmy felt . . . sick. Yep, at least one of us has to get sick on every international trip we take, and this trip Jimmy drew the short straw. A cold has been chasing him for a couple days, and today it finally caught up. 



I had heard him sniffling and sneezing all night, so I decided to go ahead and let him sleep in, and began making new plans for spending the day by myself. When he woke up there was a lot of angst on his part about how much of the day he wanted to participate in. We had a chocolate and beer tour planned for the late afternoon, so he decided to get ready, grab breakfast at the hotel, then decide if he wanted to sleep until the tour. After a shower, breakfast, and a little bit of encouragement on my part (which basically meant I promised him we could spend all morning at a museum) he decided he wanted to participate in the whole day.



First on the docket was wandering the royal quarter of Brussels, which included the royal palace and the royal museum of fine arts. The inside of the palace is closed to the public in the winter, but we snapped a couple outside pics and noted that the flag was flying over the palace, which Rick Steves stated meant the king was somewhere in Belgium. 



Here’s a statue of Leopold II we saw on our walk to Royal Museums of Fine Arts.

We also saw some lovely trees with red berries.

The Royal Museums of Fine Arts: Jimmy’s mothership in Brussels



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId8.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId8.jpg)



The Royal Museum of Fine Arts is actually made up of three museums: The Old Master’s Museum, The Fin de siecle, and the Magritte Museum. We started with the Old Masters. Normally I would want to spend about 20 minutes in the museum and Jimmy would spend hours. This time I came up with a little game that I think could become a spin off blog entitled Sheep Bottoms in Fine Art.



Here are some example:




[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId10.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId10.jpg)



To play the game you look closely at each work of art and discover any possible sheep bottoms. Then you document them in picture form.



Here are some other favorites from the old masters:

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId13.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId13.jpg)



The Fin de Siecle, which focuses mainly on Art Nouveau pieces of the 1900’s. This museum is spread out over like 8 floors, which start in the basement and expect you to keep descending. Here are some examples from that museum.

The museum is so deep that they have the cushiest elevator I’ve ever seen to take you back up to main floor. It had comfy seats.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId18.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId18.jpg)



The final museum to Magritte Museum. Magritte is a famous Belgian Surreal artist who made his home in Belgium. He mainly did painting, but also experimented with sculpture and film. The museum put his art into the context of his life, and it was especially fun to learn about his lifelong relationship with his wife. They seemed pretty cute together.



Here are examples of his work.

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId22.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId22.jpg)



We spent so much time in the museum that we ran out of time for a nice lunch, so instead we hit the streets for some quick eats before our tour. Here’s where we wondered.

Brussels definitely delivered in the festive Christmas spirit department. It was also a Saturday and they were having their famous Christmas market, so it was either crowded or lively depending on your frame of mind. I loved Brussels, so I’ll call it lively.

We did our duty and taste tested a Belgium street waffle. They had tons of toppings you could put on, but I preferred mine plain and portable.

Again, it’s lively

This was the cute square where our tour started. We also found lunch at an organic health food café which was quick and got us a dose of veggies. Upstairs it had some seating with an amazing view of the cute square with the Christmas market.

This is where the chocolate and beer tour met, and our first chocolate stop. The tour was put on by The Brussels Journey, and if you only do one thing in Brussels I recommend this. Our guide knew everything, and was hilarious, and we got to meet people from all over the world. In our group we had people from Germany, Australia, Portugal, Norway, Spain, and a few of us from the US. Including a couple who everyone knew was from Texas before they stated it. They were very sweet people and we don’t generally have anything against Texans, but they hit a lot of stereotypes. We also had a twenty two year old travel blogger on the tour never once asked anyone else a question about them. She had a lot to say about herself, thought, including giving a diatribe on traveling in Portugal to a group of us which included the couple that was actually from Portugal. We felt lucky to get to spend a lot of the tour getting to know a young couple from Norway, which was awesome for us because we got to ask them a lot of questions to prepare for our trip to Norway next fall. And they were just awesome people.

We had one of the guide’s helpers take a pic of us in front of the cute square. Unfortunately a car drove by just at the wrong time. Oh well



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId44.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId44.jpg)

The tour was great because it not only educated us on Belgian beer and chocolate, it also went over some history and famous places in the historic center. For example, Belgium is also famous for French fries, which they call frites. Fun fact, Belgium actually invented Frites (French fries). They told us that the name doesn’t come from them originating in France, it comes from the style of cut of the potato (which is the French style). Makes the whole Freedom Fries debacle even more ignorant. 



Here’s a classic frites place. I love the guys with the hats



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId46.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId46.jpg)



Here are some of the fun buildings we saw as we walked



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId47.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId47.jpg)



Chocolate shop #2 is a family owned place. They are a chocolatier which means they do they entire chocolate making process in house. They were amazing!



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId48.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId48.jpg)



Some of their chocolate



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId49.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId49.jpg)



At this point in the tour darkness started falling, the city began lighting up. The building with so many lights it looks on fire was our next chocolate shop.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId50.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId50.jpg)



It’s called Pierre Marcolini, and he is one of the most famous chocolatiers in Belgium. His creations were awesome, and his marketing with Christmas lights was amazing as well. Our guide said the store gets a different theme each year. His chocolate is also some of the most expensive in Belgium. 



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId51.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId51.jpg)



Get ready for a ton of pics of Christmas lights

After that, the chocolate part of the tour was over, and the beer part began. Jimmy got pics of all the beer so we could remember which ones to buy later, but I won’t post them all. Here are some highlights. This pic is a Trappist beer we were drinking in the oldest pub in Brussels. Trappist beers are beers brewed by actual monks in an abbey, and some proceeds go to charity. Cheers!

More wandering pics

Tavern #2 used to be a puppet theatre, and still hosts puppet shows on the weekend. We also got a nice Charcuterie plated with Belgian cheese, meats, and olives.

The third place was very modern, but no pics of that one. I don’t really like beer, but it was fun to learn about the origins and Jimmy found some new favorites, including snapping a rare pic of this one, which I think was his absolute favorite.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId71.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId71.jpg)



We also got to see some of the famous Brussels wall murals.



Including Tin Tin, a famous Belgian comic character



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId72.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId72.jpg)



And Manneken Peace, who is the hip hop persona of the famous Brussels statue Manneken Pis. 



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId73.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId73.jpg)



Now if you do any research on Brussels, you will stumble upon their most famous public art piece, Manneken Pis. This is a statue of a little boy peeing. Am I joking? Nope. Belgians have a great sense of humor, and seem to have really embraced him. Tourists get excited about him too. No one really knows the story behind Julien (the boy), but they have embraced the statue, and often dress him up in costume. I was hoping for a great costume when we saw him, but he was naked. He’s also tiny and crowded by people, so if you go to Brussels just to see him, you will be disappointed. Definitely ask some locals about some of the legends around the statue, though. Those are pretty awesome. 



Here’s the actual Manneken Pis

The tour ended up going overtime, and we wanted to stay longer with our new Norwegian and German friends, but had dinner reservations so we had to run. Our last Brussels experience was to try out some of their famous mussels. Mussels in Brussels. Mussels are generally cooked in wine and served in bucket in Belgium, but neither Jimmy or I really like mussels, so we got them baked in cheese, garlic, and butter. They were awesome!







[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId76.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171209/imagerId76.jpg)



And came with traditional Belgian Frites. Another note about Belgian frites, they are deep fried twice in beef fat and served with mayo. Because Belgium is the best!



And with that, we caught an Uber back to our hotel, because we thought we were flying out early. As it turned out, we got to the airport early only to find out that our flight was cancelled due to the fact that it was currently snowing in Brussels. Icelandair booked us on new flights through Delta for no extra cost, which was awesome because Delta has more movie choices, feeds you, and is a lot more expensive, however it also put is getting home late Sunday night with a return to work Monday morning. After a few additional delays we ended up surviving the ordeal, and are excited to be home so we can bring the Christmas magic here to Seattle.



Thanks to our friends and family who followed us on our journey! We had another amazing trip!



Good night.
