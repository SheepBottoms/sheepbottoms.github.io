Yep, you read correctly. We woke up this morning so because I had booked the incredibly special activity of seeing a jail.

Kilmainham Gaol is most famous for being the place where the English confined and executed member of the Irish Easter Rebellion in 1916, however, prisoners had been housed there long before that. Visiting was an incredible experience, and a visitor’s center was completed just this year to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the uprising.

The outside of the gaol looks like an old fortress, and the oldest part of the gaol was built in the late 1700s.

The old part of the gaol looks like a dungeon, with narrow corridors and very little natural light.

The newer part has more of an open concept with natural light in the middle and the cells along the end.

They have plaques above the doors of cells that housed famous Irish revolutionaries, and some carved words or phrases into the top of the doorways.

Grace Gifford was even able to paint a mural in her cell, which you can see when you look through the small hole.

We also got to see the outside “yard” that prisons would get one a day in to walk around in the circle.

Also outside was the area where the revolutionaries from the Easter uprising were execute by firing squad. A cross marks the spot where they were forced to stand, while a cross on the other side of the yard marks the place where they had to place a chair for revolutionary James Connolly who was too injured to stand.

After seeing the yard, we were taken back to the entrance, which looked kind of lovely with a fierce looking dragon carved on the top of the doorway. We were then told that the balcony above us was where prisons were publicly hung before Victorian morals kicked in and let everyone that was pretty terrible.

After the gaol we decided to recuperate with some sandwich lunches at a place recommended by a taxi driver. It was great, and provided a short but enjoyable walk to the Irish National Museum of Archeology.

Jimmy and I decided to test out my new portrait lens while there.
Jimmy lookin’ awesome:

Me, clearly up to no good.

The Archeology museum was pretty cool, but it houses a lot of half-preserved bodies that the Irish have dug up from bogs. Jimmy and I termed them “Bog Bodies”, and will not show pictures here because we’re pretty sure we’re going to have nightmares and we really don’t need to share the love.

Jimmy, however, did find a Viking boat, and looks like he’s decided to commandeer it.

After that we visited the Irish National Gallery. Many of the displays were in storage due to restoration (thank goodness) or we would have there for hours. Jimmy loves paintings; I love them for about an hour. 
After we looked at every piece of art on display, we headed back to Grafton street to enjoy street performers, Christmas lights, and shopping.
