Most people who travel know that even the best laid plans can go awry. Welcome to my day. It started out well enough. We took the train to Belfast, and sat next to lovely young woman who is a native of County Antrim but is currently living in Vancouver BC. The countryside was beautiful, although getting pictures from a moving train never works out well. Here’s my best attempt.

We’ve had amazing weather on the trip so far, and haven’t seen any rain. The woman on the train stated, “Oh just wait. You’ll see rain soon. It’s always raining in the Northern coast.” True to her word, as we moved further north, the clouds rolled in. By the time we got to Belfast there was a steady rain, but we are Seattlites who feel completely at home in the cold wet. 
Jimmy and me rocking our rain prowess.

Jimmy’s also rocking his “find lunch” prowess.
We decided to wander Queen’s Quarter, which is the area around Queen’s University. It’s a great little area a little outside the city center, full of brick townhomes with lots of character.

 And it’s home to an amazing restaurant called Molly’s Yard.
Molly’s yard serves incredible food (although it’s a bit of a splurge) and it’s housed in a converted Victorian carriage house and stable, which basically means that it’s adorable.

After lunch we had some important choices to make. We really only gave ourselves half a day in Belfast, so we needed to decide what to do. When we were in Dublin I had read that a sculpture garden of CS Lewis Chronicles of Narnia characters had opened in November of this year. CS Lewis was a native of Belfast (although I think he moved away when he was a child), but they are pretty proud of him here. I knew that I NEEDED to see those sculptures. The other main attractions in Belfast are the sectarian murals (we’ll be seeing similar ones in Derry) and the Titanic Belfast museum. I saw online that tickets to the Titanic Belfast were less expensive if you go later, so we decided to see the statues, then head over to the Titanic quarter. 
The statues are outside the city center, so we called a cab. The driver was nice enough at first, and joked about different accents of English speaking countries. After a while the conversation took a strange turn (completely on his end) into terrorism and bombings of police cars in Belfast, then became pretty overtly racist. Which was awkward because we were stuck in this dude’s cab. 
We finally got to the statue park, and escaped what was quickly becoming an increasing awkward situation. The actual park was awesome.

First, we followed CS Lewis through the magical wardrobe

We ran from Maugrim, the White Witche’s wolf captian

The White Witch offering me Turkish Delight, which I’m sad to say I totally ate. It was delicious.

Mr. Tumnus, who appeared uncomfortable with the hugging situation.

And the stone table, which is broken.

Because Aslan is free!

After all that fun, we took another, not-so-racist cab to Titanic Belfast. We entered inside to see this beautiful chandelier
 
 [![picture]({{ site.images }}/20161220/pic24.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20161220/pic24.jpg)

and were promptly told that it closed early in winter and we missed it. We were also informed that we would need to wait for over half an hour for a cab to get out of the Titanic Quarter and back to the city center. Epic fail.
We waited, and cab showed up to take us to the Crown Liquor Saloon for dinner, which is an incredibly ornate Victorian pub. We were so happy to be eating!

Right until the moment when I realized my phone was missing. We used the find your phone app, and watched it quickly driving back across the river and towards the airport. I had left it in the cab. I called the cab company, and the driver agreed to bring it back, as long as I would meet him out front. Jimmy and I debated who should go, but I believe in natural consequences for my clients, so I went down to wait in the rain while Jimmy enjoyed his yummy dinner. 20 minutes later, he shows up and I’ve got my phone back.
I have to brag on Jimmy for a minute. Through that whole experience he never got flustered or angry with me. I felt terrible, and he ordered a sticky toffee pudding to share to try to make the night up. He’s a keeper. 
We went for a walk after dinner and saw some of the city center of Belfast

Including the Hotel Europa, which claims to hold the world record for being the hotel that has been bombed the most. One of our non-overtly-racist cab drivers told us, “But not recently. That was back in The Troubles”.

We also saw an interesting mural

And a church that looked like something out of a gothic novel

And with that, sweet dreams . . .
