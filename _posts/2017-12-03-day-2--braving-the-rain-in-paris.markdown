Day 2: Braving the Rain in Paris



Whoo. Today was wild. But totally in a good way.



We started by waking up at 2am . . . Very lame. It made me think of the Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness song “Fire Escape.” I heard Jimmy moving around as much as I was, so I turned to him and sang 



“You’re my number one/Your’re the reason I’m still up at dawn/Just to see your face/ We’ll be going strong/ with the vampires baby/ we belong, we awake.”



 Mild grumbles were heard, then I’m pretty sure we both fell back asleep.



We actually woke up at 6am in the hopes of hitting Versailles before the major crowds. Paris does a cool thing on the first Sunday of every month, where they make a lot of their tourist attractions free. It’s awesome, but it also means more people. We wondered around the Marais district at 7am (before the sun) scrounging around for breakfast. We felt very Parisian as we were able to grab chocolate croissants and espresso at a bakery, then hit up a produce stand just as it was opening for a banana. If anyone has seen the movie “Amelie”, it totally reminded me of the produce stand she visits, complete with the owner yelling at his helper.



Here’s a café decorated for the season:

After getting breakfast we got on the RER train to Versailles. We didn’t quite beat the crowd, but it was a very rainy morning so it seemed like it kept a lot of people away.



Here are the gates waiting to get into Versailles

We also got to meet some great people in line, so it really wasn’t a big deal. Versailles was pretty ornate, and it seemed to make perfect sense why the everyday person starving outside the Chateau would want to revolt and behead everyone inside. There was a lot of decadence.



Here’s the entry

And some of the rooms inside

The famous hall of mirrors. More of a hall of tourists today

And the view back to the courtyard

After visiting the inside, we headed out into the rain to look at the gardens. They were pretty bear because it was winter, but it was still fun to look around.

One of the things I really wanted to see at Versailles was Marie Antionette’s hamlet. Apparently, she felt bogged down by dreary palace life, and created a hamlet where she could like a peasant life. Without actually doing work that peasants have to do. It looked like the set of Beauty and Beast to me.

I found a very large and furry bunny, who was very insistent on hiding behind a tree.

We then got completely lost trying to find our back to main palace. Luckily, it was lovely.

And we found French sheep! I get to add those to my list of sheep.

Eventually we found our way out of Versailles, headed back on the train to visit the Roding Museum and sculpture garden. Basically a guy named Rodin made a ton of sculptures, and now his house is a museum of them. Jimmy loved the neighborhood around the museum.

Here’s the museum:



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId32.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId32.jpg)



And some sculptures. Some are inside the mansion, some are around the garden outside.

I bet it’s especially nice in the summer, but it was lovely in winter too.



After visiting the museum we decided we had earned a snack. We headed out to the Champs ‘Elysees for some macaroons at the famous Laduree. The boulevard was closed to traffic when we got there. We’re not sure why, but it was kind of awesome.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId39.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId39.jpg)



That’s the Arc de Triumphe at the end of the street. 



This is one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world. Believe it or not, this is the entrance for an Abercrombie.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId40.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId40.jpg)



I also found a Disney store with the Eiffel tower.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId41.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId41.jpg)



While we were walking, all the Christmas light came on.

We decided we deserved a warm beverage and some good dessert, so we waited in line for a few minutes for a table to Laduree. It was amazing! The hostess gave us a window right by a window overlooking the Champs-Elysees, and we ended up ordering a trio of amazing desserts.

The very AMAZING, and of course, we couldn’t leave without our little box of macaroons to go.

Last on our list for the day was going to the top of the Arc de Triumphe. The traffic was back, so we had to cross it. We kind of got stuck in the middle for a harrowing moment, but made it to the tunnel entrance safe and sound.



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId50.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId50.jpg)



[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId51.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId51.jpg)



Then, it was up to the top. It was so beautiful!

[![picture]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId57.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/20171203/imagerId57.jpg)



By that time, we were exhausted, and headed back to Jewish quarter for more falafel sandwiches. Which has become and very cheap, and much beloved evening tradition.

At this point Jimmy is already in bed asleep, and I need to be headed that way myself. An amazing day in Paris. Good night.
