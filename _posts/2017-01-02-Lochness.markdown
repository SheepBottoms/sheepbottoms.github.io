What a beautiful place! Today we had the extreme privilege of being able to drive through the highlands of Scotland. We started the day in Edinburgh, which we very sad to leave because there was so much more we wanted to do there. We shall return!

When we travel, Jimmy and I think it’s really important to not just spend all of our time in big cities, but to venture out into the countryside and see what we find. We love the cities, but we usually end of liking the smaller towns and hikes better.

The drive was spectacular, and we were blessed with some pretty decent weather. The highlands are interesting because the terrain changed so rapidly. We saw hills, what looked like mountains, snow, rain, sunshine, forests, and valleys all within the course of a couple hours.

I tried to make friends with some highland locals, but they seemed hesitant. They moved in a group to the corner and stared at me. It was kind of rude.

Our first stop in the highlands was to check in on Loch Ness, and see if we could find the monster. Loch is the Scottish word for lake, so all lakes in Scotland begin with Loch. We got a pretty good view of the lake from a car turnoff, and we headed to the Loch Ness Monster exhibition centers.

One of them was called Nessieland, and was blaring terrible bagpipe music. We walked by that one. The second one looked very informative, but it was getting later and we didn’t really want to spend the best daylight hours inside, so we moved on.

The best view of the lake was from Urquhart Castle. The castle is actually in ruins now, but there’s a great visitor’s center with a information video, and walking through the ruins gives amazing views of Loch Ness.

There were a couple times when we thought we saw something moving in the water, but we weren’t sure. Looking at the pictures, what do you think? Can you see the monster, Nessie?

Huh, no luck this time.

Jimmy said he was right behind me.

Oh, there he is.
We made it the castle just as the sun was setting, which made it extra beautiful.

After visiting the castle we continued to make our way north-west, heading towards the beautiful island of Skye. It was dark before we reached the island, so we aren’t really sure what it will look like in the daylight, but we’re very excited to find out.
Here’s some pics of the highlands at dusk.

That’s the Eileen Donan castle lit up at night. You’ll see it in the daylight on our next post.
One of the fun things about traveling in winter is you can get great deals on hotels. We got to stay at the incredibly lovely Cuillin Hills hotel in Portree, which is the highest rated hotel on Skye and would cost about 250 pounds to stay there in summer. In winter, we got an incredible room with a cooked breakfast for around 70 pounds. It felt so luxurious after all of our nights in AirBnB’s.

Everything was closed in Portree when we arrived, so we had dinner at the hotel with a view overlooking the harbor lights, and then turned in early. Lots of hiking to do tomorrow as we explore the Isle of Skye.
Goodnight.
