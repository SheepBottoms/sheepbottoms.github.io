# Introduction to the trip
Welcome back friends, family, and random internet creepers,

Hi everyone!
We’re back to our blogging, and getting ready to head international! For the first time ever Jimmy and I gave up on our blog and didn’t complete on our last trip to So Cal. I know it was a huge let down, and ruined everyone’s day. We’ll try to do better. 
On this trip we are heading back to France, and Jimmy is getting his first experience of Switzerland. I was very fortunate to be able to visit Switzerland with family when I was a pre-teen, but I remember less of it than I wish I did. 
Jimmy has been working like crazy on his French skills over the past six months or so, and is hoping all of his hard work is about to pay off with some authentic and simple conversations in French. Although, I keep asking him how to order food and he keeps stonewalling me . . .

## The Basic plan

This trip happened because Jimmy and I decided to invite ourselves on a friend’s birthday trip to Paris. We’ll be meeting up with my friend Melissa and her mom, and spending a few days in Paris with them. From there we will spend a bit of time in the Burgundy region of France, before heading in to Switzerland.
In Switzerland we’ll be spending time in Bern, Lucerne, and Zurich. We’ll also journey into the Alps to play in the Bernese Oberland (hopefully we’ll get good weather and can venture up to the highest place in Europe) and visit Zermatt to see the Matterhorn. The temperatures are in the negatives there right now, so send warm thoughts our way!
At the end of our trip we’ll be heading back into France to visit the Alsace and Champagne regions, where we hope to have some great food before heading back to the US.
We can’t wait to share our fun with our friends and family, and I’ll do my best to keep up with my posts. 
Bon Voyage!

Paige and Jimmy
