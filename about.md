# Introduction to the trip
Hi friends, family, and random internet creepers,
Jimmy and I are ridiculously excited to be preparing to embark on our next European adventure! This time we're headed to the UK, Ireland, and Iceland.  For those who loved us enough to follow us on our last blog, welcome back! This time around we've attempted to upgrade with a new blog format and the use of a surface rather than our phones. The plan will be to add daily entries to the blog (as time and wifi allows) so our parents can rest assured that we're still alive. Below is the basic outline of our planned travels.

## The Basic plan

We will begin our travels with the only repeat location from our last trip: Ireland. We're going to spend some time in Dublin, our current favorite city in the world, then will travel to Northern Ireland to visit Belfast, the Causeway Coast, and Derry/Londonderry. 

Our next destination will be England. We will focus most of our time in London, with short trips to Bath, Stonehenge, and York. 

From York we will travel to Scotland.We're starting in Edinburgh where we will get to join in the Hogmanay celebrations, then will do a driving tour of the Scottish Highlands (we're coming for you, Nessie) on our way to the Isle of Skye. From Skye we will heasd back down through the highlands to end our trip in Glasgow. 

Our final destination will be a few days stopover in Reykjavik in Iceland, and then a direct flight home.
