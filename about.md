# Introduction to the trip
Welcome back friends, family, and random internet creepers,

Jimmy and I are so excited to be going on our next international adventure, and are happy to announce that we are finally going somewhere other than Europe! We are beginning to tackle learning more about a new continent by spending 10 days in Japan.

For those who loved us enough to follow us on our last blog, welcome back!. We've developed quite a loyal and enthusiatic following (mainly consisting of our parents, my sister, and a few very loyal friends who love us enough to follow us on our adventures), and we hate disappointing our fans (mainly my sister who gets on my case if I don't post each day) so we're going to try to stick to our plan of posting everyday. Our research indicates that WIFI is spotty in parts of Japan, so we'll see how this goes

## The Basic plan

Japan is a large country to tackle in 10 days, so we're focusing our time on Tokyo and Kyoto, with quick adventures to nearby locations.

We'll be starting out in Tokyo, spending a few days visiting historic temples, a royal palace, neon streets, and attending the national Sumo wrestling competition. We're also planning to do A LOT of eating, a little bit of shopping, and I am very excited to have talked Jimmy into spending a day at Tokyo Disney Resort vsiting their Disney Sea Park. 

After Tokyo, we're heading into the mountains to visit a traditional Ryokan (or Japanese inn) in a hotsprings town with it's own private onsens (or natural hot tubs). We're also visiting the snow monkeys who often hang out in their own hot tub created by a natural hotsprings. We'll see if they're up for hot tub lounging in May.

From the mountains we'll journey to Kyoto where we'll get to visit lots of cultural sights, enjoy a traditional tea ceremony, visit beautiful gardens, and have a tradition Kaiseki dinner with Geisha. We'll also be daytripping to Hemji to visit one of the oldest castles in Japan and visit their restored Samuri village. Also, more shopping and eating in Kyoto. 

Wish us luck!

Paige and Jimmy
